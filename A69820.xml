            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of Chriſt, for his life, doctrine, and
miracles; for his death, reſurrection and aſcenſion, is copiouſly
deſcribed by the foure Evangeliſts: But the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of
Chriſt, for the reaſons, cauſes and effects of his ſufferings and
actions, eſpecially ſince his aſcenſion into heaven and ſeſsion on
the Throne of God, is exactly revealed in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes; which
ſeems in manner of an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex unto the Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>For that Epiſtle is frequently interſerted with ſeverall
deep myſteries, containing, as it were, the hiſtory of Chriſt in heaven.
How there in the behalf of the faithfull, he <hi>executes</hi> the ſacred
office of his everlaſting Prieſthood; <hi>whereby he is able to ſave them
for ever, who come unto God by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ever liveth to make
interceſsion for them.</hi> How he <hi>commiſerates</hi> and ſuccours
them in all their afflictions and trialls; <hi>for having himſelfe 
<pb facs="tcp:61860:3"/>been afflicted and tried, he thereby learned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of a
mercifull high Prieſt.</hi> How he <hi>expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates</hi> and propitiates them
from all their former ſinnes, and from all their after-lapſes whereinto
they fall through ignorance or infirmity; <hi>for by one offering he hath
perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> How he <hi>juſtifies</hi>
and here difies them to that eternall bleſſedneſſe, whereof he is the
heire and the donor, to admit them as co-heires with him; <hi>for he is become
the author of eternall ſalvation unto all them that obey him.</hi> How hee
<hi>conſecrates</hi> and dedicates their perſons and all their ſacrifices
or holy ſervices of prayers, praiſes, and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, which through
him become acceptable to his Father; <hi>for he is a Miniſter of the heavenly
Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle which God hath pitched, and not
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therein is further accurately diſcourſed, what admirable
benefits and prerogatives are from Chriſt redundant to the faithfull; <hi>for
whom he hath obtained a Miniſtery ſo much more excellent, by how much he is
the Mediator of a better covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi>
What neceſſary duties of holineſſe the faithfull on their part, over
and beſides their faith to believe, are bound to performe, for the
application and efficacie of thoſe benefits, to render them effectuall to
their ſalvation, which without holineſſe can never be <pb facs="tcp:61860:3"/>attained; <hi>for as without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God:
ſo without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> What vertue and power
thoſe benefits have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience, to withdraw her from dead workes,
and to engage her in all endeavours of holines to ſerve the living God, by
way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God for his grace in Chriſt; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the ſoul is ingratefull and ungracious. What ſolid comforts and
aſſurances, under all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of this life, ariſe unto the
ſoule from her endeavours of holineſſe, without which no ſoule is
capable of ſolid and aſſured comfort? for a ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſinfull
ſoul may be ſometime flattered and deceived, but effectually comforted and
aſſured ſhe can never be, untill in ſome meaſure ſhe bee purged
from her ſinfulnes, and qualified by deeds or deſires of holineſſe.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of theſe and the like points, the divine
Author of that Epiſtle proceeds after a grave and ſolid manner, yet
ſoaring ſometime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to expreſsions and reaſonings ſo ſublime, that
he ſeems to penetrate the higheſt heavens, and there to behold our Saviours
actions. For the points he proſecutes are high myſteries, of things ſo
diſtant and remote from ſenſe, that (as himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD</hi>] The ſupreme and univerſall father, ſtiled
in the old Covenant, the God of Iſrael, but in the new, the Father of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>At ſundry times</hi>] in the ſeverall ages of
the world; as in the time of the ſervitude in Egypt, in the time of the
Judges, of the Kings, and of the Captivity, and a while afterward, till about
the finiſhing of the ſecond Temple. <hi>And in divers maners</hi>] At one
time after one maner, at another after another: as to Moſes God ſpake in a
ſingular and familiar maner, otherwiſe then to any other Prophet; for he
ſpake with Moſes mouth to mouth. Num. 12.6. And he knew Moſes face to
face. Deut. 34.10. But to other Prophets God ſpake after another maner;
eyther by Angels as his delegates, or by a voice ſounding in their eares, or
by a viſion before their eyes while they were awake, or by a dream while they
were aſleep. <hi>Spake</hi>] Declared his will and pleaſure for precepts,
promiſes or judgements; whether by voice, viſion or dreame. <hi>In times
paſt</hi>] Anciently, during the time of the Tabernable, and the firſt
Temple: for after the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond Temple, God ſpake very
rarely any way. <hi>Vnto the Fathers</hi>] Not to the Patriarchs, but to the
people of Iſrael and Judah, who lived in the time of the Prophets, and were
anceſtors to thoſe Hebrewes to whom this Epiſtle is written. <hi>By the
Prophets.</hi>] As by Moſes and Samuel, by Elias and Eliſha, and by the
reſt of the Prophets whoſe workes are extant in the ſacred Canon of
Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In theſe laſt dayes</hi>] The time of the
Goſpel is called the laſt dayes; partly as oppoſed to the words before
<hi>in times paſt;</hi> partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time of the Law and the
Prophets was before it; but chiefly becauſe the Church under the Goſpel
ſhall not receive from God any more Innovation or alteration; for the time of
the Goſpel ſhall laſt till time ſhall be no more, till eternity; and
therefore is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture the laſt dayes. See Act. 2.17.
<hi>By his ſon</hi>] Jeſus Chriſt who here is oppoſed to the Prophets,
by whom God ſpake in time paſt. Not that the Prophets were no way the
ſons of God, but becauſe in compariſon of Chriſt they were not ſo
accounted. For Chriſt by whom God ſpake the Goſpel was more eminently the
ſon of God then any of the Prophets, 4 wayes: 1. By his conception;
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was conceived of a Virgin by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61860:4"/>2. By his function; becauſe he was ſanctified by God and
ſent into the world, to publiſh and confirme the new Covenant; for which
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he muſt needs reſemble God as a ſon the father, in divine
wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, holineſſe and power. This reaſon Chriſt gives why he called
himſelf the ſon of God, John 10.36. 3. By his Inſtitution; becauſe God
appointed him his univerſall heire as an only ſon is to his father. 4. By
his Reſurrection; becauſe thereby he was immortaliſed, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed
from death and mortality; and conſequently deified as the ſon of God. This
reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives applying to the Reſurrection of Chriſt the
words of the Pſalme, Thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee. Act.
13.33. <hi>Whom he hath appointed heire</hi>] God hath appointed Chriſt to
inherit the ſovereigne dominion and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; firſt by granting him
a right or title to it; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by giving him the reall
poſſeſſion of it. Yet he poſſeſſeth it not ſucceſſively
after his father, as the manner is among men; but acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and joyntly
together with his father. <hi>Of all things</hi>] His univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall heire; he
alludes to an only ſon, who is the ſole heire of all his fathers eſtate.
For Chriſt is the <hi>unigenit</hi> or only ſon of God; not that God hath
not other ſons, but that he hath none ſuch as he. Seeing then God is the
univerſall proprietary and Lord of all things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt being his
only ſon and heire, becomes univerſall Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of all things, over all
Angells and men, whether alive or dead. <hi>By whom alſo he made the
world.</hi>] God by the mediation or meane of Chriſt did reforme and
reſtore mankinde who is the chiefeſt part of the world, by giving him a new
ſtate and condition by a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For the Hebrews who have no or few
compound verbs, ſay a thing is made, when in regard of ſome qualities it is
altered or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or made otherwiſe then it was before, by aſſuming a
new forme or faſhion for a better condition. So we are ſaid to be created
in Chriſt to good workes, and we are called a new creature; not in regard of
any new creation, or new nature; but becauſe of new relations unto God, or
new qualities in our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Who being the brightneſſe of his glory</hi>]
Chriſt was the luſtre, raye or beam of Gods Majeſty. For ſeeing God is
inviſible and cannot be ſeen of men, by reaſon of his immenſe and
infinite light; therefore God ſent forth Chriſt as a raye or beam of his
light, that in Chriſt men might have a kinde of ſight of Gods Majeſty.
<hi>And the expreſſe image of his perſon</hi>] Theſe words doe but
interpret the former. Adam and in him every man made is made in the image of
God, to reſemble God in ſome of Gods attributes: but Chriſt is the
character or image of Gods perſon; for God did as it were imprint his
perſon upon Chriſt, that Chriſt might be his ſubſtitute upon earth to
perſonate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and reſemble the perſon of God; to be in
wiſdome as God, by publiſhing the myſteries and ſecrets of God, and by
knowing the <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61860:5"/>thoughts of men; to be in holineſſe as God,
without all ſtaine of ſin; to be in power as God, having dominion over all
creatures, over windes, ſeas, and devills. For ſuch divine wiſdome,
holineſſe and power, are brightneſſes, images, or markes of Gods
Supremacie, or Soveraigne Majeſtie. <hi>Vpholding all things by the word of
his power.</hi>] Chriſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all things by his powerfull Command; for
according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſence, Word is put for Command; as Pſal. 33.7. and
Pſal. 143.15. And the <hi>Word of his power,</hi> is an Hebraiſme alſo,
for his powerfull word. q. d. Chriſt did perſonate God, not onely for the
acts of his power; but alſo for the manner of his acts, becauſe he wrought
all his miracles by his ſole Word or Command. For at his Word or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the
windes ceaſed, the ſea calmed, diſeaſes were healed, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels were
ejected, and the dead raiſed. And to this the Centurion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his faith,
when he ſaid, Lord, Speak the word only and my ſervant ſhall be healed.
Mat. 8.8. <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſinnes.</hi>] Chriſt
offered up himſelf in his own perſon, and did not as the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Prieſt, who uſed to offer ſacrifices that were not himſelf; but
Chriſt was both the Prieſt who offered, and the ſacrifice which was
offered. And by this oblation of himſelfe, he expiated or purged away our
ſinnes, by removing our guiltines and the puniſhment due to our ſins.
Chriſt was a ſacrifice to expiate our ſinnes; and the ſlaughter of this
ſacrifice was made on earth upon the croſſe: but the offering of this
ſacrifice was then performed, when he entred into heaven, and made his
Appearance in the preſence of God; as the Leviticall Prieſt after the
ſacrifice was ſlain, entered into the Sanctuary to offer the blood of it.
And this Oblation of Chriſt had then onely an efficacy or power to expiate
our ſins; but the effect of it followes not upon us, till we on our part
performe our office, by beleeving in Chriſt and obeying him. <hi>Sat down on
the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi>] The Leviticall high Prieſt
when he went into the Oracle, where God was ſaid to dwell and ſit betweene
the Cherubins, did not ſit downe with God, betweene the Cherubins: but
ſtood as a miniſter or waiter with great reverence of the Divine
Majeſtie, offering and ſprinkling that blood wherewith he entered. But
Chriſt aſcending on high, and entering into heaven, did not ſtand before
the Throne of God as a miniſter or ſupplicant, but ſat downe at the right
hand of Gods Majeſtie. Yet he ſat not by way of an Aſſiſtant unto
God, as Nobles and Councellers doe to earthly Princes: but by way of
Cor-regnant to reigne with him, having abſolute power over the people or
Church of God, and for the Churches ſake over all other things. For
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.25. To ſit at the right hand of
God, is to reigne and governe as God; And Chriſt doth now reigne and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
abſolutely and arbitrarily in all things not defined by Gods law; but where
Gods law orders things, there he governs accordingly.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61860:5"/>4. <hi>Being made ſo much better then
the Angels.</hi>] The Apoſtle formerly having tacitely preferred Chriſt
before all the Prophets, and before the high Prieſts; proceeds now to compare
and preferre Chriſt before the Angels, to wit (which muſt be marked) from
the time of his ſeſſion at Gods right hand, corregnant with him.
Whereupon he layes down this poſition or doctrine, That Chriſt ſitting at
Gods right hand, reigning with him in abſolute power, is become more
excellent then the Angels. This doctrine he preſently proves, by ſeverall
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments following. <hi>As he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
name then they.</hi>] This is the firſt argument whereby he proves his former
doctrine; becauſe Chriſt hath obtained a more excellent name then the
Angels. By name here, we are not to underſtand that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or dignity of
Chriſt, whereby he reignes with his Father in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power; for this
were to argue tautologouſly, ſeeing he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that before. But by name
he meanes the Appellation or title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt, noting his ſtate and
condition: For from Appellations and titles, eſpecially given by God, we may
eaſily gather the dignitie and excellency of any perſon. And this excellent
name, Chriſt hath <hi>obtained by Inheritance,</hi> Which ſhewes, that he
had it not by nature nor from eternitie, but in time, by grace from the favour
of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time
thou art my ſon.</hi>] He confirms his former reaſon, by a teſtimony from
Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. Why Chriſt hath a more excellent Name then
Angels; Becauſe God gave Chriſt the Name or title of Sonne, which is a
title of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour above that of Angels, whoſe name or title ſignifies them,
to be the Meſſengers or Legats of God. The Angels in generall are ſome
time in Scripture called the Sons of God, as <hi>Iob</hi> 1.6. But God on his
part never calls them ſo in generall; much leſſe doth he ſingle out any
one peculiar Angel apart from the reſt, to entitle him by the name or Son.
But God entitles Chriſt by that Name, Thou art my Sonne; thou and no other
perſon properly: For the Pronoune <hi>thou,</hi> is here put excluſively,
to ſequeſter all other perſons beſide, from the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that
name as a proper and perſonall title. Indeed as the Angels in generall, ſo
all Chriſtians are in common called the Sonnes of God: but Chriſt onely is
ſo called peculiarly, perſonally and ſingularly. <hi>This day have I
begotten thee.</hi>] He confirms, why Chriſt is ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entituled and
named the Sonne of God; becauſe God after a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar manner hath begotten
him, i. Raiſed him from the dead (for in Davids Pſalmes from whence this
teſtimonie is taken, extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers reſemble death) and made him moſt
reſemblant and like to God himſelfe, by giving him Immortality and
univerſall Royalty to bee King over his people. For this generating or
begetting of Chriſt hath reſpect to his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion;
for ſo Saint Paul expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it, Acts 13.33. Not that Chriſt was
not begotten or not called <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61860:6"/>the Sonne of God before his
Reſurrection; but becauſe by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he was moſt
aſſimilated and made ſemblant unto God, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made an immortall and
univerſall King, whereby he had the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree under God; therefore
God is ſaid to have then begotten him, and then to call him his Sonne: For
God is called God by reaſon of his ſupream power and dominion; whereof they
alſo are called Gods and the ſons of God, that have power and dominion; and
the greater their power is, or the nearer it reſembles Gods power, ſo much
the rather, and more neerly are they his ſonnes. And he is moſt of all his
Sonne, whoſe power and dominion is made either the ſame with Gods, or
equall to it. Chriſt was the Sonne of God before his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; for
during his prophetick function, he was a great Potentate, and wrought powerfull
miracles: but after his Reſurrection upon his Regall office, he became moſt
neerly and highly the Sonne of God, becauſe then God made him an immortall
and univerſall Potentate; for then all Power was given him in heaven and
earth, Mat. 28.18. <hi>This day</hi>] It is an Hebraiſme, frequently added to
ſpeeches, wherein ſome remarkable matter is either done or given, or
promiſed, or commanded; as in this place; to the end that day might be kept
in memory, or as it were remaine for a day of Commemoration, that the action of
that day might be kept in perpetual remembrance, See Gen. 4.14. Jer. 1.10. and
many places in Deuteronomie. <hi>And againe; I will be to him a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he
ſhall be to me a Sonne.</hi>] Hee confirmes that Chriſt is the Son of God
from another teſtimony of Scripture, 2. Sam. 7.14. which was literally
ſpoken of by Solomon; as the former teſtimony of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, but both
myſtically of Chriſt; Intimating the deare love and affection of God toward
him; whereupon it muſt needs follow, that Chriſt muſt be exalted to a
moſt excellent ſtate and condition above all other perſons, And as
theſe words were ſpoken of Solomon future<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before hee was borne, and
indeed the Sonne of God: ſo alſo of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And again, when he bringeth in</hi>] Another
teſtimonie of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to prove Chriſt better then the Angels; becauſe
all the Angels are commanded to worſhip him; which muſt needs follow upon
the ſtate and condition of his filiation. For all ſervants muſt worſhip
or reverence their maſters ſonne and heire, eſpecially then, when his
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had made over his inheritance or eſtate unto him. This teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is taken out of 97. Pſalme; whereof the inſcription in the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, is,
A Pſalme of David when the land was reſtored unto him; namely, when his
kingdome was reſtored, after his expulſion from it by Abſolon, but
myſtically meant of Chriſt. And therefore <hi>againe,</hi> may well be
referred to his bringing in: For after Chriſt was expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the world by his
death and buriall, God brought him into the world againe by his Reſurrection,
in raiſing him from the grave. <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61860:6"/>
                  <hi>The firſt
begotten</hi>] Chriſt is the firſt begotten Sonne of God; becauſe God
begot him before all his other ſonnes, who are called the brethren of
Chriſt; for God firſt begot Chriſt, in that manner wherein God is ſaid
to beget ſons; for thoſe he begets whom he aſſimilates and makes like
unto himſelfe, and ſo Chriſt was the firſt that was aſſimilated or
made like unto God in holineſſe; in ſuch holineſſe as he requires in
the new Covenant. Secondly, Chriſt is the firſt begotten of God by his
Reſurrection, becauſe by the power of God hee was raiſed and brought in
againe from death to an immortall life; for which cauſe hee is called the
firſt begotten from the dead; and the firſt fruits of them that ſlept. 1.
Cor. 15.20. Laſtly, he is the firſt begotten in all things whatſoever,
whereby the faithfull of Chriſt, become the ſons of God; for Chriſt hath
preceded them all, that (as St. Paul ſpeakes) he in al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the world,</hi>] Firſt to be upon the earth a while after his Reſurrection
from the grave, but chiefly when he brought him into heaven, which is the
ſuperiour and future world, and ſeated him at his right hand; for then
Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Lord and head over men and angels; and till then the
angels worſhipped him not. For in this ſence the Apoſtle here takes the
world as himſelfe ſhewes in the next cap. ver. 5. where he ſaith, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

are Imperative, laying a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon all the angels of God, none excepted, to
worſhip Chriſt; and therefore it followes that Chriſt is made much better
then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. In the Hebrew of the Pſalme it is, Worſhip him all ye
Gods; where the word Gods is oppoſed to Idols, which were the Heathen Gods,

argument from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture. Pſal. 104.4. to prove Chriſt
made better then the angels. <hi>Who maketh his angels ſpirits.</hi>] This is
not ſpoken of their <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61860:7"/>Creation, but of their Emiſſion,
that God employeth them as his Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or Meſſengers, to ſhew
their ſtate and condition to be ſervants unto God, wherein they greatly
differ from the ſtate of Chriſt, ſitting at Gods right hand, and is not
ſent forth any whether. <hi>And his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters a flaming fire.</hi>] Herein
the Author aimes at no more, then what he ſaith at the laſt verſe of this
Chapter, that they are all Miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; ſaving that he alludes
from the Pſalme to the manner of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; which is like a ſpirit
or a winde, very forcible, and yet inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and like a flaming fire or
lightning, very penetrable, ſubtile and agile, moving almoſt in an
inſtant from one part of heaven to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>But unto the Sonne he ſaith, Thy Throne O
God!</hi>] Herein hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Chriſt to the Angels, and preferres him
above them, from a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture, Pſal. 45.6. which is literally
ſpoken of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but myſtically of Chriſt; And therein Solomon is
ſaid to have a throne, and called God, for the royalty of his throne, and
ſublimitie of his power over Gods people. And therefore Chriſt, of whom
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon was but a ſhadow, is by a farre greater right called God; becauſe
the Throne of Chriſt is farre more royall, in being ſeated at the right
hand of God. And conſequently, Chriſt is farre better, and ſuperiour to
the Angels, as the King ſitting on his throne, is greater then his
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that miniſter unto him. <hi>Is for ever and ever.</hi>] Solomons
throne or kingdome, is ſaid to be everlaſting or perpetuall, becauſe hee
was promiſed to reigne in his perſon, and in his poſteritie after him for
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages; Namely, ſo long as the carnall and earthly ſtate of Gods
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould require an earthly King, See Pſal. 89.28,29. and verſe 36,
37. For that Solomons poſteritie were deprived of the kingdom before the
coming of Chriſt; (which notwithſtanding was reſtored in Chriſt, though
after a more divine and ſpirituall manner) that hapned through the ſoule
ſinnes of his poſteritie, which God neither would nor could any longer
tolerate. Seeing God put this Article or condition in the Covenant which he
made with David and his poſteritie, that his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhould obſerve
his Law, See 1. Chron. 28.7. But this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of throne or kingdome agrees
farre more eminently unto Chriſt; becauſe Chriſt was made immortall to
live for ever, and to raigne in his owne perſon for ever, without any
poſterity to ſucceed him; and he is to raigne ſo long as the people of
God ſhall need ſuch a King; which Throne muſt needs laſt to the end of
the world, till all his enemies be deſtroyed. And conſequently the Throne
or Kingdome of Chriſt is moſt properly and truely everlaſting for ever
and ever. <hi>A Scepter of righteouſnes is the Scepter of thy Kingdome.</hi>]
Scepter, is figuratively put for government, becauſe it is the enſigne of
Royall government; and Scepter of righteouſnes is by an Hebraiſme put for a
righteous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Literally, Solomons government was very juſt &amp;
righteous; <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61860:7"/>and myſtically the government of Chriſt, is
moſt juſt and righteous over the faithfull, who are Gods people.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Thou haſt loved righteouſnes, and hated
iniquity,</hi>] Theſe words doe but amplifie and illuſtrate the former.
Literally, Solomon did not only governe righteouſly, but loved to doe it, and
hated to doe the contrary. And myſtically Chriſt loved it much more; for he
commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no iniquity nor ſinne at all; he never did any man injury, nor
ſuffers it to be done unpuniſhed. <hi>Therefore God hath anointed thee with
the oile of gladneſſe.</hi>] He alludes to the anointing of Kings, or
rather to the anointing of gueſts at feaſts, which was an ancient
cuſtome, becauſe oyle doth exhilerate and refreſh the ſpirits, and
cheer up the minde, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being perfumed with ſome ſweet odour. And
therefore <hi>Oyle of gladnes</hi> is an Hebraiſme put for exhilerating and
cheering oile. To this cuſtome the Pſalmiſt relates, Pſal. 23.5. and
our Saviour, Matt. 6.17. and Luke 7.46. The literall ſence is; God did
entertain Solomon more delicately then other men, endowing him with
extraordinary gifts and graces; particularly with theſe three, Wiſedom,
Riches, and Glory; for he gave him his owne asking, and that beſides which
hee asked not, See 1. Kings 3.5. for his extraordinarie wiſedome, See 1.
Kings 3.12. and 1. Kings 4.29. for his Riches and Glory, See 1. Kings 3.13. and
1. Kings 10.21. to the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The myſticall ſence is, That as
God was the God of Solomon to endow him: ſo he was the God of Chriſt
alſo, who endowed Chriſt anointing him with the holy Ghoſt, and with
ſpirituall graces in farre more extraordinary manner, for ſpirituall
wiſedom, whereby he knew the ſecrets of God, and the thoughts of men; with
ſpirituall riches, which is holineſſe and righteouſnſſe; with
ſpirituall power and glory to have dominion over all men and angels, See Luk.
1.15. and Luk. 4.1. and Luk 2.40. and Mat. 12.42. and Joh. 1.14. and Joh. 1.16.
<hi>Above thy fellows.</hi>] The literall ſence is; Solomons brethren, who
were the reſt of Davids children, were cheerfully anointed, or bleſſed of
God, with Wiſedom, Riches, and Honours; but Solomon was bleſſed above
them all in a ſingular and eminent degree, and advanced by God to the
Kingdome of Iſrael before and above them, ſo that all they were not onely
rejected from the Crowne, but made ſubject to him. The Myſticall ſence
is. All the faithfull like Solomons fellowes or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are begotten from
the ſame Father that Chriſt is begotten; and are anointed with the holy
Ghoſt, and have many things common with Chriſt; yet notwithſtanding
Chriſt is anointed by God above all the faithful; hath an immence meaſure
&amp; power of the holy Ghoſt powred upon him; eſpecially after his
reſurrection from the dead, when he was totally ſanctified, and advanced to
be King and Lord over the faithful.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>And, thou Lord, &amp;c.</hi>] A fourth Argument to
prove Chriſt, better then the Angels taken from a teſtimonie of Scripture,
Pſal. 102. <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61860:8"/>verſ. 25, 26, 27. And here wee muſt note,
that this Teſtimony doth ſo farre onely belong to Chriſt, as it conduceth
to the ſcope of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; which as appeares at the fourth verſe of this
chapter, is to prove, that Chriſt after that he was ſeated at the right
hand of God, was made better then the angels. To which purpoſe the Creation
of heaven and earth makes nothing at all: For that cannot be referred to
Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Author had taken it for granted, and for a ground
that Chriſt is the ſupreme God; becauſe all this teſtimony out of that
Pſalm is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtly ſpoken of
the ſuprem God; but that Chriſt ſhould be that God is not intimated by
any word in all that Pſalm. And therefore if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had taken this for
graunted, that Chriſt is the ſupreme God, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Author had
diſcourſed very impertinently and ambiguouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to furniſh himſelfe
with ſuch ſtore of arguments, and ſo many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scriptures,
(and thoſe much more obſcure then the point to be proved) thereby to
evince, that Chriſt was better then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the Creatour, better then
the creature. This had been to bring proofs no way neceſſary for a point no
way doubtfull; ſeeing all might have been diſpatched in one word. We muſt
therefore further obſerve, that this Teſtimony out of Pſalme 102.
containes three clauſes. The firſt concerning the Creation of the world. 2.
Concerning the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the world. 3. Concerning the Duration of God;
for theſe three things are the ſubjects of three verities contained in that
Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and all three are ſpoken ſupremely, and primarily of God the
Father: But the firſt can no way be referred to Chriſt, becauſe (as is
before noted) it could not make for the Authors purpoſe. The laſt, referres
both to God and Chriſt; for the Duration of Chriſt is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and
everlaſting; yet this clauſe makes nothing for the Authors purpoſe, to
prove Chriſt better then the Angels, becauſe for Duration, the angels are
equall to him, ſeeing they alſo are immortall, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
perpetuall and everlaſting. The ſecond clauſe referres to God ſupremely
and primarily, and to Chriſt ſubordinately or ſecondarily; for God by
Chriſt will deſtroy the world; God hath given to Chriſt a tranſcendent
power to deſtroy and aboliſh heaven and earth. And this makes fully to the
Authors purpoſe, and proves Chriſt clerely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the angels; who
have not this power granted to them. Now to the words of this Teſtimony in
particular. <hi>Thou Lord in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>] God when firſt he began the
world; even in the firſt beginning of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is viſible workes, <hi>Haſt
laid the foundation of the earth.</hi>] He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to buildings which are
raiſed upon a foundation; for the earth is as it were the foundation and
ground-work of the world. And hee mentions the earth in the firſt place,
becauſe in the raiſing of all build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, men begin from the foundation.
Now the earth is termed the foundation, becauſe it ſeemes immoveable and
fixed, as all foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be. <hi>And the heavens are the works of
thine hands.</hi>] The <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61860:8"/>heavens are all thoſe vaſt bodies
which doe circumveſt the earth and one another. And they are called heavens,
plurally, becauſe they are built and raiſed to the height of three regions
or ſtories each above the other. The firſt and loweſt heaven is vulgarly
called the aire; wherein flie the fowles of heaven; and therein are the
ſupernall waters that are ſaid to be above in the heavens, as clouds,
raine, haile and ſnow. The ſecond or middle heaven, is vulgarly called, the
firmament, wherein are all the fires that give light and heat to all the world;
as the Sunne, Moone, and Starres. The third and higheſt heaven, is called by
St. Paul Paradiſe; wherein God, and Chriſt, and the angels doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
themſelves. All theſe are the workes of Gods word, and were wrought at his
command: For God ſaid, Let them be, and they were ſo, Gen. 1.6. God
commanded, and they were created, Pſal. 148.5. Yet the Pſalmiſt terms
them the works of Gods hands, alluding to the ſpeech of the vulgar, whoſe
hands and not their words are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their works, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
therefore are called the works of their hands. Hitherto of the firſt clauſe
of this Teſtimony, concerning the Creation of the world, referred to God
onely, who only was the Author of it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>They ſhall periſh.</hi>] Now followes the
ſecond Clauſe of this Teſtimony concerning the deſtruction of the
world; referred to God ſupremely and primarily, but to Chriſt
ſubordinately and ſecondarily, becauſe the power to deſtroy the world
is given to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore principally ſerves to the Authors
purpoſe to prove him better then the angels. <hi>They ſhall periſh.</hi>]
The heavens and the earth ſhall periſh, or be utterly deſtroyed and
aboliſhed; as this Author phraſeth it afterward in this Epiſtle, chap.
12.27. they ſhall be removed, as things that are concuſſible and
corruptible. And as St. Peter ſaith more expreſly, 2. Epiſtle 3.10. The
heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall
melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo ſhall be burnt up. Now things that
paſſe away and are no where, muſt needs have no being, and a thing burnt
up muſt needs periſh. Here we have a clear teſtimony that this preſent
world ſhall be deſtroyed and aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For if (as ſome have imagined)
it ſhall only be endued with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter qualities, and be changed into a
better ſtate, ſo to remaine under that ſtate, how is it ſaid to
periſh? Certainly things changed into a better ſtate to be permanent under
that ſtate, cannot be ſaid to periſh. Shall the Saints be ſaid to
periſh, when they are changed from mortall and corruptible creatures to
become immortall and incorruptible, and be made partakers of a nature and
ſtate far more pure and perfect then they had before? certainly no. Or if the
world ſhall have a perpetuall permanſion or abiding for ever; how is it
oppoſed to Gods and Chriſts permanſion or abiding for ever? which is the
ſcope of this reaſoning, as appeares in the words immediatly following: But
thou remaineſt; and thy yeers ſhall not fail. <hi>And they ſhall wax old
as doth a garment.</hi>] <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61860:9"/>The heavens are compared to a
garment, becauſe as hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they doe circumveſt, envelop,
and enwrap the whole earth round about, as a garment envolves the body; and
therefore the attribute of a garment, which is to veterate and wax old, is by a
Metaphor fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the heavens: Not that the heavens doe inſenſibly
wax old, and wear out with length of time, as garments uſually doe: but
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at laſt they ſhall wholly be aboliſhed; therefore they are
ſaid, to wax old as a garment, becauſe a garment waxen old, and worn out,
is at laſt wholly aboliſhed and caſt away: For veteration or waxing old,
is a motion or paſſage toward deſtruction and abolition. Seeing that
which decayeth and waxeth old, drawes neere to vaniſhing away, as this
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expreſſeth it afterward in this Epiſtle, cap. 8. v. 13. But how
ſhall the heavens wax old, if they ſhall be renewed into a better ſtate.
Is a garment ſaid then to wax old, when it is new dreſt, by making it
ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better and neater?</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>And as a veſture ſhalt thou fold them
up,</hi>] When a garment is waxen ſo old that we have no minde to weare it
any longer, then wee uſually fold it up and lay it aſide; for properly a
garment is a looſe veſt which we uſe to weare outwardly over the reſt
of our clothing; and therefore being laid aſide, is uſually ſolded up.
Hence it appeares, that at laſt, the time ſhall come, that the heavens
ſhall no longer circumveſt, or enwrap the earth, and therefore muſt needs
be deſtroyed and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. <hi>And they ſhall be changed.</hi>] What
change muſt here be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, moe have ſhewed before; namely, a
deſtruction, abolition or periſhing; a change, not for the better, but for
the worſe; a change from being to not being; as a garment waxen old, and
thereupon fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, becomes changed for the worſe, till firſt it fall
into clouts and ragges, and at laſt rots quite away. Hitherto of the ſecond
Clauſe of this teſtimony concerning the deſtruction of the world;
referred pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily by the Pſalmiſt to God; but ſecondarily and
ſubordinatly by this Author to Chriſt, by whoſe power under God, this
deſtruction ſhall be made, and thereby is proved to be better then the
angels. <hi>But thou remaineſt.</hi>] Now follows the third Clauſe of this
teſtimony, referred both to God and Chriſt, as the ſecond Clauſe was;
yet we ſhall ſpeak of it only in reference to Chriſt, becauſe the main
purpoſe of the Author in this Clauſe, is to prove, not that Chriſt herein
is better then the angels, but to ſhew upon the by, that the Duration of
Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Kingdom, doth not only exceed the age of the world
which ſhall be deſtroyed, but ſhall be everlaſting and perpetuall
remaining for ever. The world ſhall not remaine, but ſhall ceaſe to be:
But Chriſt ſhall remaine and never ceaſe to bee: but if the world be
Innovated into a better ſtate, to remaine ever under that ſtate, wherein
ſhall ſtand the oppoſition betweene the Duration of the world and
Chriſt? certainly in nothing. <hi>Thou art the ſame,</hi>] The 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61860:9"/>heavens and earth ſhall not be the ſame alwayes, but at
laſt ſhall be changed from being to not being. But Chriſt once ſeated
at the right hand of God, continues alwayes the ſame, and ſhall be the
ſame ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly. <hi>And thy yeares ſhall not fail.</hi>] The world
had a beginning, and then her years began, but becauſe ſhe ſhall be
deſtroyed and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, therefore her yeares ſhall faile and come to an
end. Chriſt alſo had a beginning of his age and yeares, but becauſe hee
is now immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, therefore his yeares ſhall never have an end; but ſhall
run forth in to eternity, and laſt everlaſtingly.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>But to which of the angels ſaid he at any
time,</hi>] The fift and laſt Argument to prove Chriſt better and greater
then the angels, taken from a teſtimony of Scripture, Pſal. 110.1. Shewing
that God never vouchſafed them that high dignity and degree of honour, as to
ſit at his right hand. <hi>Sit on my right hand</hi>] The meaning of this
phraſe, ſee before in this chapter, verſe 3. For ſo great a dominion
and power, as to correigne with God over all things in heaven and earth, was
never granted to any of the angels. <hi>Vntill I make thine enemies thy
foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi>] Here is declared the expiration and terme of that
ſpirituall Kingdome, which Chriſt now adminiſters upon earth: and ſuch
a terme as therewithall ſhewes one of the greateſt and moſt excellent
effect of that Kingdome; In ſo much as it is no marvell his Kingdome ſhould
determine after the production of that effect. All which tends to the higheſt
commendation of that Kingdome. For if Chriſt had obtained that Kingdom for
ſome ſhort time, or ſhould relinquiſh it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had deſtroyed and
aboliſhed all his enemies, much would bee wanting to the dignitie of his
Kingdome. The terme therefore, unto which the Kingdom of Chriſt muſt be
produced, which alſo is a moſt glorious effect of his Kingdome, is
expreſſed, when God ſaith, untill I make thine enemies thy footſtoole.
By enemies here we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not onely the adverſaries to the
perſon of Chriſt, who once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and crucified him, or ſince to
this day blaſpheme and oppoſe him: but alſo all things adverſe and
hurtfull to the people of Chriſt, who are the faithfull. Of which enemies the
chiefeſt is death, ſo far forth as it doth hurt, or may hurt the faithfull,
who are the people of Chriſt; as the Apoſtle teacheth, 1. Cor. 15.26. For
the death which domineers and remaines upon the ungodly and unbeleevers,
ſhall not be aboliſhed; becauſe their death is no enemy unto Chriſt,
but mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and ſubſervient unto him in doing the worke upon which he
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes it. And the enemies of Chriſt, are then made his footſtoole, when
they are ſo fully conquered, that all power of doing hurt is taken from them:
or as St. Paul expounds it, 1. Cor. 15.26. when they are deſtroyed and
aboliſhed. And God is ſaid to put Chriſts enemies downe; not that
Chriſt ſhall be no agent in that action, but becauſe God gives Chriſt
the power to performe it, and Chriſt ſhall execute it <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61860:10"/>by vertue of that power that is given him. As in the Scripture, 1.
Kings 5.3. God is ſaid to have put Davids enemies under his feet; yet David
was not idle in the wars, but very active. Or as ſome King, when his enemies
were conquered, ſhould ſay that God had ſubdued them unto him; becauſe
God had given him power and courage to performe it: For that Chriſt alſo
himſelfe ſhall ſubdue his enemies, it plainly appeares from the words of
St. Paul, 1. Cor. 15.24. and Phil. 3.21.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits,</hi>]
They, i. the Angels. In the former verſe, having ſhewed the Sublimity and
Maieſty of Chriſt in his ſeat at Gods right hand, and in the victory over
his enemies, he now on the other part oppoſeth the condition of the angels;
that the great dignity of him above them, may evidently appeare. Chriſt doth
ſit; and he ſits at the right hand of God: i. he raignes as a King; and the
manner of Kings is to ſit. But all the angels (none excepted) are
miniſtring ſpirits; i. waiting ſpirits, and the manner of waiters is to
ſtand and appeare, and be ſent forth at his command upon whom they wait.
<hi>Sent forth to miniſter.</hi>] The angels are Gods meſſengers and
miniſters; for they are ſent forth, and the end of their ſending forth,
is to miniſter or doe ſervice: What miniſtery or ſervice that is, hee
will preſently ſhew, and withall will intimate how long their miniſtery
ſhall laſt, namely, till the perſons for whoſe ſake they miniſter,
ſhall attaine ſalvation. <hi>For them who ſhall be heires of
ſalvation.</hi>] The angels are properly miniſters unto God and Chriſt;
for properly a man miniſters unto him that hath a right to command him,
though his miniſtery or ſervice be many times performed for the uſe and
behoofe of another. So the angels are miniſters, not unto the Saints and
heires of ſalvation; but for the Saints, i. for the benefit and commodity of
the Saints: they miniſter unto Chriſt for the vſe of the Saints, and then
they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the Saints, when they are ſent for the cuſtody and
guard of their bodies and ſoules to provide for their ſafety in both
reſpects. For ſeeing Satan and the other devils doe not only purſue and
hurt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men, but their ſoules alſo: ſo likewiſe wee beleeve
it the office of the angels to protect, not the bodies onely of the Saints, but
their ſoules alſo. Satan hath power to inject evill thoughts into the
mindes of men, and to incite them to divers ſinnes; whom therefore the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes the Author and Parent of all ſinne, who workes effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the children of diſobedience; whom ſhee calls the Prince and god of this
world; who put it into the heart of Judas to betray Chriſt, and into the
heart of Ananias to lie unto the holy Ghoſt. Now if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can doe this, why
cannot good angels inject good thoughts, and by divers objects draw the minde
to that which is acceptable unto God? And when an angel is ſent to deliver a
man from danger, he common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly delivers him no otherwiſe, then by caſting
into his thoughts ſome <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61860:10"/>advice or counſell, whereby he
may decline the danger, or by putting ſome thought upon his adverſary,
whereby to divert him from his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended enterpriſe. Neither are wee to
underſtand that the angels are ſent forth only and ſoly for this end, to
miniſter to the Saints, but that is the principall and chiefe end; for many
times the emiſſions redound to the benefit and profit of others, both
perſons and kingdomes; but eſpecially concerning the affaires of the
Church, whereof Chriſt is Lord and Protector.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Herefore,</hi>] Becauſe wee have formerly
proved, that Chriſt is far more excellent then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>We ought to
give the more earneſt heed,</hi>] greater attention, diligence and care.
<hi>To the things which we have heard,</hi>] to the doctrines, precepts, and
promiſes of the Goſpel, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whereof who firſt publiſhed it upon
earth, was a perſon far more excellent then the Angels, who publiſhed the
Law upon Mount Sinai; as the Author ſubjoynes it afterward at the 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61860:11"/>third verſe. <hi>Leaſt at any time we ſhould let them
ſlip.</hi>] He here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſcope and end of their earneſt
attention and heed, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or revolt from the Goſpel of Chriſt;
and he alludes to a leaking veſſell, that lets the liquor run out. Now
then, we let the Goſpel ſlip and run from us, when either we forget it, or
give no further credit to it, or neglect the precepts of it, to conforme our
lives to the holy rules therein delivered. For, when the Goſpel hath not the
force upon our ſoules, to make us obedient to the rules of it, then it may be
ſaid to leake or ſlip away from us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For, if the word ſpoken by Angels</hi>] He begins
to bring a reaſon, why we ſhould take earneſt heed that the Goſpel
ſlip not from us, by an argument <hi>à mineri;</hi> for, if God
puniſhed the tranſgreſſion of the Law which was leſſe, much more
them of the Goſpel, which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Law was the word or ſpeech of
God, for God ſpake it to the people, partly by himſelfe, and partly by
Moſes, ſee Exod. 20.1. and in the ſame Chapter, ver. 22. Yet God ſpake
not the Law, either to Moſes or the people immediately by himſelfe, but by
the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meanes of Angels, who publiſhed and proclaimed it upon
Mount Sinai; ſee for confirmation hereof, Acts 7.53. and Gal. 3.19. The Law
therefore being publiſhed but by Angels, is farre inferiour to the Goſpel,
which was publiſhed by Chriſt, a perſon greater then the Angels. Hence we
may collect two verities: 1. That God truly and properly did not deſcend
downe upon Mount Sinai, and there publiſh the Law; but an Angel
ſuſteining the Name and perſon of God, publiſhed it in the Name of God.
For, if God himſelfe, beſides the Angels, and accompanied with them, had
deſcended from heaven into the Mount to publiſh the Law; then, not onely
the Authors argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had beene void, but alſo the contrary muſt needs be
concluded, That the Law in this reſpect was more excellent then the Goſpel,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God himſelfe who exalted Chriſt, and made him head over the
Angels, came from heaven to earth, and did publiſh the Law; but the Goſpel
was publiſhed but by him, who was exalted by God from earth to heaven. 2. The
ſecond verity is, That the Lord, who publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Law upon the Mount, was
not the Sonne of God, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his deity. For, if the Law were given
by the Son of God, how can this Author affirme it was delivered by Angels, and
in that reſpect make it inferiour to the Goſpel? Or, how is it at all
inferiour to the Goſpel, in reſpect of the publiſhing, if both it and the
Goſpel were publiſhed by one and the ſame perſon? <hi>Was
ſtedfaſt</hi>] The Law was ratified and eſtabliſhed, made ſtedfaſt
and firme, when it was ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with power and force for obedience, and
ſupported with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puniſhments againſt the
tranſgreſſors of it. For, when a Law is but a bare precept, and hath no
penalty annexed to it, then it is infirme and weake; but, when it is fortified
with penalties, then it is <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61860:11"/>made ſtedfaſt, and becomes a
ſanction; for thereupon men dare not ſo eaſily violate and breake it.
<hi>And every tranſgreſsion and diſobedience</hi>] The Law was made
ſtedfaſt for this end, that it might be fortified and ſupported againſt
every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, whereby men would preſume to
breake it. A tranſgreſſion is a ſin againſt an expreſſe and
knowne Law; for, every tranſgreſſion is a ſin, but every ſin is not a
tranſgreſſion; yet, every ſin may become a tranſgreſſion, namely
if it be forbidden by an expreſſe and knowne Law: Otherwiſe where there
is no Law to be tranſgreſſed, there can be no tranſgreſſion. A
diſobedience is a tranſgreſſion done with malice and contumacy; for as
a tranſgreſſion is one kinde of ſin, ſo a diſobedience is one kinde
of tranſgreſſion; yet, every tranſgreſſion may become a
diſobedience, namely, if it be committed out of malice and contumacy.
<hi>Received a juſt recompence of reward</hi>] Puniſhment is then a juſt
recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when it is congruous and ſutable to the ſin,
according to the due deſert of the ſinne. But, theſe words of the Author
cannot meane, that every tranſgreſſion of the Law without exception, had
a capitall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ordained by Law, or was <hi>de facto</hi> inflicted;
for, every penall Law was not alwayes put in execution. And thoſe
tranſgreſſions which were committed out of ignorance or infirmity, had
their expiation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Law, but diſobedients, or contempts, or, as the
Scripture termes them, ſinning preſumptuouſly, or with a high hand, could
not be expiated any other way, then by that capitall puniſhment that by the
Law was ordained, ſee Numb. 15.27. And, ſeeing it is apparent, that the
Authour ſpeakes of a matter openly and vulgarly knowne, it is not credible,
that he would be underſtood of thoſe private and ſecret judgements or
puniſhments that God himſelfe inflicted, for ſuch for the moſt part
were concealed and not knowne. Wherefore we muſt needs conceive, that this
Author takes not the particle <hi>every,</hi> logically and ſtrictly, but
vulgarly, for the moſt part of tranſgreſſions and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediences, and
hath ſpeciall reſpect to the ſacred precepts of the Law, and to the
examples of thoſe perſons, whoſe tranſgreſſions againſt thoſe
Laws are mentioned, and whom the Scripture teſtifies to have beene ſeverely
puniſhed of God, according to their demerits. For, if in ſome caſes the
rigour of the Law was mitigated, as in the caſe of David; thoſe caſes
being extraordinary and rare, muſt not take place againſt the generall
rule. Although David alſo had no ſmall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God upon him;
ſo that here the Author ſpeakes of divine puniſhments which God
himſelfe inflicted; for, otherwiſe it would not follow, that the Law was
made ſtedfaſt with God, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Magiſtrate puniſhed
tranſgreſſors; but, becauſe God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did it, or tooke order it
ſhould be done, either by the Magiſtrate, or by others. For, when he
ſpeakes on the oppoſite part, concerning the contemners of the Goſpel,
the puniſhments are underſtood to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61860:12"/>3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape</hi>]
If the tranſgreſſions of the Law were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly and juſtly
puniſhed by Gods hand, much leſte ſhall we eſcape it; <hi>If we neglect
ſo great ſalvation?</hi>] If we neglect the Goſpel. He might have called
the Goſpel, the word ſpoken by Chriſt, as before he termed the Law, the
word ſpoken by Angels; for, this had beene enough to inferre his
concluſion, and alſo a more eloquent oppoſition; but he calls the
Goſpel Salvation, for three reaſons. 1. To expreſſe the effect and
fruit of the Goſpel, which is Salvation; for, as S. Paul ſaith of it, It is
the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, Rom. 1.16. 2. To
intimate the dignity and excellency of the Goſpel above the Law, becauſe
the Law contained no open prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe
of ſalvation, but onely hidden under ſhadowes of things, and coverts of
words; neither did the Law ſpecifie that condition, whereby men might attaine
ſalvation, but that onely whereby they incurred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and the
puniſhment of death. Hence S. Paul ſaith, The Law worketh wrath, Rom. 4.15.
and he calls the Law, the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, and a killing letter, 2
Cor. 3.6,7. So that the Law might be juſtly called rather the word of death
and damnation, then of life and ſalvation. 3. To adde force and ſtrength to
his argument againſt the danger of neglecting the Goſpel; ſeeing thereby
we neglect ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe, to which the Goſpel is the meanes. And,
he cals not the Goſpel ſimply ſalvation, but <hi>great ſalvation:</hi>]
Salvation may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and various, as of our bodies and goods in this
life; and ſuch a ſalvation was to Gods people under the Law, whereby God
ſaved them from their enemies, and thereupon is frequently in Scripture
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Saviour. Hence David ſaith of them, They forgat God their
Saviour, Pſal. 106.21. See Iſai. 45.15. and 49.26. and 63.8. But, the
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promiſed in the Goſpel, is a great and mighty ſalvation,
even the ſalvation of ſoules by the inheritance of eternall life.
<hi>Neglect</hi>] This great ſalvation in the Goſpel is neglected, when
either we deſpiſe the acceptance of it, or beleeve not the promiſes of
it, or obſerve not the precepts annexed to the promiſes, but live ſo, as
if there were no ſalvation at all, or no promiſes extant of it, or no
precepts concerning it, or as if none of theſe were knowne unto us. So that
the neglect here mentioned, meanes not ſome one ſmall ſin of negligence,
by the ſingle breach of ſome one precept, but includes a contempt and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of the Goſpel; for, it is oppoſed to the
tranſgreſſions and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediences againſt the Law, that were
puniſhed with death, as a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, at the former
verſe. If therefore they eſcaped not puniſhment, who tranſgreſſed
the Law, which promiſed not ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but onely threatned condemnation:
how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect the Goſpel, wherein eternall
ſalvation is openly promiſed, and a totall remiſſion of all our
ſinnes is offered? yet, onely upon condition, that afterward we pollute not
our ſelves with any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61860:12"/>or accuſtome our
ſelves to any ſinne, (with pardon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our infirmity) but
live holily in the ſight of God, as farre as our faith in his promiſe, and
our hope of ſalvation may ſupport us. If, I ſay, we neglect or
deſpiſe theſe things, ſo worthy of all reverence and acceptance, what
greater ingratitude can we poſſibly ſhew to God, whoſe grace, the
greater it is towards us, the greater is our ſin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, and to
deſpiſe the greateſt grace, muſt needs make up the greateſt ſin?
<hi>Which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord</hi>] The Lord
Chriſt was not the firſt Author of the Goſpel, as the Angels were not of
the Law, but God was the prime and firſt Author, both of the Law and the
Goſpel. But, as the Angels were the firſt publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers and proclaimers of
the Law upon Mount Sinai, by commiſſion received from God: So Chriſt was
the firſt publiſher and preacher of the Goſpel upon earth, by a like
Commiſſion from his Father. So the Goſpel was preached by him who is Lord
over the Angels, and whom they reverence and adore as their Lord. But,
becauſe this Goſpel of ſalvation was preached by others alſo, therefore
to ſhew the difference in the order of time betweene him and others, it is
ſaid of him, that he preached it firſt, and after him others preached it,
that were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in it by him. And, in this preaching firſt begun by
Chriſt, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all whatſoever that he either taught, or did, or
ſuffered, to gaine beliefe to his preaching, that he might firſt alſo
confirme it by himſelf, as afterward it was confirmed by others. And, leſt
any man might ſay, that all men did not heare the preaching of Chriſt
himſelfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, that Chriſt was not the ſole, but the
firſt preacher of it; and after him others, who were taught it by him, and
ſent forth by him, to preach it univerſally over all parts of the world,
who therefore were called the Apoſtles or Emiſſaries of Chriſt. <hi>And
was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</hi>] In the confirmation of the
Goſpel, the preaching of it is included, or thereby ſuppoſed. The Law was
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed or made ſtedfaſt, not onely by judgements and puniſhments
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed againſt the tranſgreſſors of it, but alſo the publiſhing
of the Law was confirmed and certified with wonderfull ſights and ſounds,
as the lightnings and thunders, and trembling of the Mount, and the voice of a
Trumpet exceeding ſhrill, that ſounded long, waxing lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and louder,
ſo that all the people in the Camp trembled, Exod. 19.16. Now, leſt any man
ſhould think, that the Goſpel either in this regard was inferiour to the
Law, or was but a vaine novelty, that wanted ſolid arguments and proofes,
both for the verity of it, and the publiſhing of it; therefore the Goſpel
alſo was confirmed and certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt divine teſtimonies, that were
without all exception, and ſuch as were never ſeene nor heard of in the
world before. <hi>Vnto us</hi>] To this Author, and others. <hi>By them that
heard him</hi>] that heard Chriſt publiſh and preach the Goſpel. The
Goſpel was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61860:13"/>firmed by Chriſt, by
vertue of his miracles and ſufferings, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his publiſhing of the
Goſpel, his miracles and ſufferings were confirmed by them that heard his
preaching, &amp; ſaw both his miracles and ſufferings; even by them that
were conſtant auditors of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and ſpectators of his miracles;
ſuch as were eſpecially the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and diſciples of Chriſt. Hence
it may not improbably be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That Paul was not the Author of this
Epiſtle. For hee never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts himſelfe from the number of the Apoſtles,
nor reckons himſelfe as a hearer of the Apoſtles, as the Author of this
Epiſtle here doth. Paul alwaies preſerved his Apoſtolick authority, and
maintained it entire againſt all that maligned it; and he was eſpecially
ſo to doe, when hee had to deale with the Hebrewes or Jewes, who depraved and
ſlighted his authority. Neither was any Apoſtle the Author of it: but
ſome Apoſtolick perſon, who had learnt the Goſpel from ſome
Apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>God alſo bearing them witneſſe,</hi>] The
Apoſtles after Chriſt, did ſecond Chriſt in preaching and confirming
the Goſpel; yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it not by their owne power, but by divine
power; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it was from God, becauſe God did beare witnes
of their doctrine, and gave his ſuffrage to their ſayings. Who therefore
would not yeeld his faith and belief, to ſo great a confirmation, and to ſo
great a teſtimony of ſo great a witnes? Neither could theſe things be
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by theſe Hebrewes to whom this Epiſtle is written, ſeeing they
themſelves had ſeene and heard the preaching of the Goſpel confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before them. <hi>Both with ſignes and wonders and divers miracles.</hi>] Here
hee ſhewes by what meanes God did confirme the preaching of the Goſpel by
the Apoſtles; namely, by meanes of two ſorts;by the workes of miracles, and
by the gifts of the holy Ghoſt. Signes were teſtimonies in generall, that
the Apoſtles were ſent of God, and ſpake the truth. Wonders were ſignes
alſo, yet but one ſort of ſignes, namely, the ſublimeſt and moſt
powerfull kinde that bred aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the people; ſuch as raiſing
the dead, and the falling downe of Ananias dead; And theſe ſignes and
miracles were not all of one ſort, but various and diverſe; as caſting
out of devils, raiſing the dead, others falling downe dead, giving ſight to
the blinde, and blindnes to others, as to Elymas the ſorcerer; by healing
diſeaſes, not only by their word, but by the ſhadow of Peter, and by the
handkerchief of Paul. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this confirmation of the Goſpel, St.
Auſtine ſpeaks very wittily. Wee know (ſaith hee) that almoſt all the
world was drawne unto Chriſt by the force of miracles. They that deny this by
eluding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, they themſelves make a greater miracle. For when ſo few
Apoſtles, ſo unlearned men, preached things ſo incredible to humane
reaſon, that all the world anciently ſeaſoned with other Religions,
ſhould beleeve them without any miracles; this is a more incredible miracle,
then any of thoſe miracles, which they are ſaid to have done. 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61860:13"/>
                  <hi>And gifts of the holy Ghoſt,</hi>] for gifts, the
originall hath diſtributions: The ſecond meanes of confirming the Goſpel
preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was by the diſtributions or gifts of the holy
Ghoſt. This the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor names in particular, becauſe it is a moſt divine
work, &amp; moſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Goſpel, That at the preaching of the
Apoſtles, or at the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of their hands, the holy Ghoſt was given to
thoſe that beleeved at their preaching. He calls them diſtributions or
gifts diverſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, becauſe the gifts in themſelves were diverſe,
and alſo were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly imparted to diverſe perſons. Not one and the
ſame gift to all, but one to one, and another to another; one to diverſe,
and diverſe to diverſe, in diverſe manners, to one in a leſſe
meaſure, to another in a greater, according to the meaſure both for
quantity and quality, that it pleaſed Chriſt to conferre theſe graces.
See 1. Cor. 12.11. and Epheſ. 4.5. For this variety and diverſity in
diſtributing the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt; did greatly redound to
the benefit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Church, who is one great Corporation or
body myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, compoſed of various and diverſe members; that ſome
ſtanding in need of others help, might more mutually conſpire in love and
unitie among themſelves. <hi>According to his owne will.</hi>] The power to
diverſifie and varie the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt, was not at the
will and pleaſure of the Apoſtles, but was a prerogative reſerved to God,
and the diſtribution was varied according to his own will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>For unto the Angels</hi>] He returnes to his former
point of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt above the Angels; for which he brings a new
Argument, and withall tacitely ſhewes the cauſe, why Chriſt being one
ſomewhat inferiour to the angels, in reſpect of his mortall nature, was at
laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be far greater and higher then they. The reaſon hereof
was, becauſe the future world to come was to be ſubject to Chriſt, and
not to the angels: For to this purpoſe, the words cited out of the eighth
Pſalme, that the world to come muſt be ſubject to a man, are by the
Author applyed to Chriſt; as the like is done by Paul, 1. Cor. 15.27. and
Epheſ. 1.22. And this teſtimony of Chriſt being made better then the
angels, ſeemes to be reſerved for the laſt place; becauſe by this
meanes, he might both diſſolve the doubt, why Chriſt being firſt low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the angels, was at laſt made much higher then they; and alſo might
prepare himſelfe an entrance to explicate the cauſe of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of
Chriſt, whereat he principally aimed; and ſo gradually proceed to handle
the Prieſthood of Chriſt. <hi>Hee hath not put in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the world
to come</hi>] The world future or to come, is that place wherein now dwelleth
God, and Chriſt, and all the holy Angels; but hereafter in time to come all
the godly ſhall dwell there. And it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led future or to come, in
reſpect of the godly, to whom it is yet future or to come; whereas the place
in reſpect of it ſelfe, of God, Chriſt, and the Angels is already,
preſent, and really extant. The right or title <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61860:14"/>of
dominion and inheritance, God hath neither given, nor decreed to give unto the
angels. The angels now inhabite in that future world, but yet as the houſe
and kingdome of another, and not as their owne; for God ſhould do them no
injury, if he ſhould pleaſe to tranſlate them from that ſeat, and
command them to ſettle elſwhere: becauſe they are not Lords of that
world, but ſervants there. And that hither wee may apply the words of
Chriſt, John 8.35. The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever, i. hath
no right to abide for ever, though <hi>de facto</hi> of grace he may abide for
ever: but the ſon abideth ever, i. hath a right to abide for ever.
<hi>Whereof we ſpeak.</hi>] Theſe words as wee noted in the former chapter,
verſ. 2. are added reſpectively to his former words, wherein he mentioned
the worlds ſimply, without adding the word future, or to come; that he might
here give us to underſtand, that there alſo he meant the world to come; for
that was the world whereof hee ſpake both there and here.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Eut one in a certaine place teſtified,
ſaying,</hi> It was not for want of knowledge or memory, that this Author
here quotes this text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture indefinitely, without citing the place; for
ſeeing he knew to recite the words ſo exactly, and the words themſelves
were ſo vulgarly knowne, how could he be ignorant of the place? But becauſe
this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the place of it was ſo vulgarly known, eſpecially to
the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, to whom he writes, therefore he neither noted the place, nor
named the Author of them. And it was his manner ſo to doe, though he cite
many texts of Scripture. Indeed afterward, chapter 4.7. hee quotes David as
Author of a ſaying formerly cited by him: but his intent there is to
manifeſt, the order of time, and not the name of the Author. <hi>What is man
that thou art mindfull of him</hi>] The words are Pſal. 8.4. To be mindfull
of a man, is to be carefull for him, and make proviſion for his good. The
literall ſence is, God made proviſion for the man Adam, the head and father
of all mankinde, and gave him the right of dominion over this viſible,
earthly, and preſent world, and over all the creatures therein contained,
Gen. 1.28. The myſticall ſence is; God made proviſion for the man
Chriſt, the head and father of all the faithful; &amp; gave him the right of
dominion over the inviſible, heavenly, and future world, and over all the
creatures therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, 1. Cor. 15.27. Epheſ. 1.21,22. and Phil.
2.9,10. For by man here is underſtood in both ſences, the firſt Head and
Parent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, naturall and ſpirituall; namely, Adam the firſt man,
and Chriſt the ſecond Adam. For in both theſe perſons, that which is
expreſſed in the words, is fulfilled fully, though diverſely. <hi>Or the
Sonne of man that thou viſueſt him?</hi>] To viſit, is frequently to
regard and often to looke unto; and argues the mindfulneſſe or
carefulneſſe formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; for the perſon, of whom we are mindfull
and carefull, him wee frequently viſit, goe to ſee, and looke unto him. The
literall ſence is, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61860:14"/>That mankinde, for his naturall birth
is the ſon or poſterity of the man Adam. God gave Adam the dominion over
this earthly world, yet not perſonally for himſelfe onely, but for him and
his ſons, or poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity after him. For, though he were ſole Lord over his
ſons, during their minority, while they were under age, and under his power;
yet afterward as they grew up in the world unto maturity, or fulneſſe of
age, then the like right ſhould be communicated and imparted unto them, that
they alſo might be Lords over this earthly world. For God gave the earth
alſo to the children of men, Pſal. 115.16. The myſticall ſence. The
faithfull for their ſpirituall birth are the ſons of Chriſt. God hath
given to Chriſt the dominion over the heavenly world, yet not perſonally
for himſelfe onely, but for him and the faithfull, who are his ſons and
poſterity after him. For though now Chriſt, the ſole Lord over the
faithfull, during their minority, or nonage in this world, while they are under
the power and tuition of Chriſt, yet when they come to ſpirituall maturity,
which is their immortality, then the like dominion ſhall be communicated and
imparted unto them, and they alſo ſhall be Lords and poſſeſſors of
that heavenly world to come. For, then they ſhall no longer be under
Chriſt, but beſides him, to reigne with him, 2 Tim. 2.12.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Thou madeſt him a little lower then the
Angels</hi>] The literall ſence is. God made man lower or inferiour then the
Angels, a little in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for his nature, becauſe he made man by nature
mortall, but the Angels by nature are immortall; and a little in time, for man
continues in this lowneſſe of his mortall nature for a little time,
reſpectively to the time of his immortality, though abſolutely it be a long
time, even from the Creation to the Reſurrection. The myſticall ſence is.
God alſo made Chriſt lower then the Angels, a little in degree for his
mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall nature, but a very little in time, onely during his mortall life,
which was but as a moment. <hi>Thou crownedſt him with glory and
honour:</hi>] The literall ſenſe. The dominion that God gave man over this
preſent world, was a great glory and honour to him, even a Crowne or high
degree of glory. For, all dominion is honourable, and the higheſt is
coronable. The myſticall ſence. The dominion that God gave Chriſt over
the world to come, was much more glorious and honourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a heavenly
dominion over Angels is more glorious, then an earthly dominion over beaſts.
<hi>And didſt ſet him over the works of thy hands.</hi>] Theſe words do
but expreſſe wherein mans dominion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that was ſuch a glory
and honour to him; namely, in bearing rule over the earthly creatures, which
were the works, not of his owne hands, but of Gods. So the Dominion of Chriſt
conſiſteth in ruling over the Angelick and heavenly creatures, who are the
works of Gods hands alſo.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under
him:</hi>] Theſe words <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61860:15"/>are but correlative to the former;
for, if man were ſet in dominion over all things, then all things were put in
ſubjection under him. But the particle <hi>all</hi> muſt be reſtrained
from its abſolute univerſality, concerning all things whatſoever, to be
limited onely to all earthly creatures, as all ſheep and oxen, and the
beaſts of the field, the Fowles of the ayre, and the Fiſh of the ſea,
&amp;c. as they are immediatly reckoned up in the Pſalme. But, in the
myſticall ſence, the particle <hi>all</hi> muſt be left wholly to his
abſolute univerſality and full amplitude, for all things both in heaven and
earth; namely, all creatures whatſoever are put in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under
Chriſt; becauſe, from the univerſality of Chriſts domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God onely
is excepted, who did put all things beſides in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Chriſt,
1 Cor. 15.27. <hi>For, in that he put all, be left nothing not put under
him:</hi>] In theſe and the words immediately following, the Author
diſcovers and teacheth us, that this place of the Pſalme muſt be
underſtood of ſome other man then an earthly man: For the words being
abſolutely uttered, are a cleere argument, that the holy Ghoſt would have
them taken in ſome other ſence altogether univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, in which latitude
S. Paul alſo takes them, 1 Cor. 15.27. In ſo much that in them, the world
to come is alſo comprehended. And taking the words univerſally, who ſees
not, that during this mortall life, they cannot be verified and fulfilled of a
mortall man? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author immediatly addes; <hi>But now we ſee
not yet all things put under him:</hi>] <hi>Now:</hi> while man lives this
preſent and mortall life; <hi>not yet:</hi> not from the beginning of the
world, to this preſent time, we ſee not all things univerſally made
ſubject to any mortall man, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man was made leſſe or
lower then the Angels, but for a little time, as wee ſhewed before. And
therefore the fulfilling of theſe words, that all things univerſally, even
the world to come ſhould be ſubject to man, cannot be meant of any mortall
man, but of ſome man tranſlated to immortality. Yet, who that immortall man
ſhould be, the Author hath not hitherto declared. But, in the following
verſe, he ſhews that it is Jeſus Chriſt tranſlated to immortality.
Whence it appeares, that if we reſpect the myſticall ſence of the words
in this Pſalme, they muſt be taken principally and properly of Chriſt;
but of Chriſtians, onely reſpectively and as it were proportionably. For,
no one of the faithfull ſhall ſolely and ſingly poſſeſſe all
things; but, all joyntly as coheires ſhall poſſeſſe all things: yet,
not all the faithfull joyntly ſhall poſſeſſe all things
univerſally, though ye ſever them from Chriſt their head; for they
ſhall not have dominion over the Angels, but Chriſt onely ſhall
poſſeſſe all things univerſally; for, he only ſhall rule over the
Angels, that hath dominion over the faithfull. And yet againe there is one
perſon excepted from the dominion of Chriſt, and that is God the Father,
who hath given to Chriſt his univerſall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61860:15"/>9. <hi>But we ſee Ieſus who was
made a little lower then the Angels</hi>] Here he declares who that man was, in
whom the words of the Pſalme were to be fulfilled; namely, that Jeſus
Chriſt was the man, to whom all things univerſally, and therefore the world
to come was to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and therewithall makes way to handle the
Prieſthood of Chriſt. And hence now it appeares, that in this there is no
abſurdity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to truth, that he, who in reſpect of his mortall
nature was a little lower, for a little time then the Angels, ſhould be
exalted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much higher then they for ever after. Yea, ſeeing the
Scripture teſtifies, that the man who was leſſe then the Angels, muſt
become Lord of all, who ſees not that the exaltation of the man Chriſt, far
above all the orders of Angels, doth excellently agree with Scripture? And,
hereby the Author removes the abſurdity that ſeemes in this, That Chriſt,
a man, ſhould become far greater then the Angels, and be ſaid to be their
Lord. <hi>For the ſuffering of death</hi>] The Reaſon, or cauſe why
Chriſt for a little time was made a little lower then the Angels, was this,
that he might ſuffer death. And this was not the formall cauſe of his
lowneſſe, for he was not made lower then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in this reſpect, by his
ſuffering death; an evill which they ſuffer not, though it be true that he
was alſo lower therein. But the formall cauſe of his lowneſſe was his
mortall nature, in reſpect whereof he was made for a little while a little
lower then the Angels. And the finall cauſe of his lowneſſe in that
mortall nature, was actuall death; for, he was made in a mortall nature to this
end, that he might ſuffer death under it; for, unleſſe his nature had
beene dyable, he could not have dyed. Chriſt was made a mortall man, whereby
for a little while he was a little lower then the Angels; but why, to what end
was he not at firſt made immortall, but mortall? It was to this end, that he
might be paſſive to ſuffer death; for, had he beene at firſt made
immortall he could not have dyed. <hi>We ſee him crowned with glory and
honour:</hi>] Chriſt hath now an univerſall dominion over all, not onely
over this viſible and preſent world and all the creatures here, but alſo
over the inviſible and future world, and all the creatures there, which is a
crowne or higheſt degree of glory and honour to him, whereto he was exalted
after his ſuffering of death. And though it be moſt true, that his
ſuffering of death was the cauſe or occaſion of his exaltation to glory;
for, Paul expreſly ſo affirmes it, Phil. 2.8,9. Yet in this place the
Author here intends not to ſpeake of Chriſts death as the cauſe of his
glory, as appeares by the words here following; For, in what ſence can it be
ſaid, that Chriſt, becauſe he ſuffered death, he was crowned with glory
and honour, that he ſhould taſte death for every man; as if after his
crowning with glory he ſuffered or were to ſuffer death? But here his
intent is to ſhew Chriſts death for the order of it, that for time it was
antecedent to his glory, and his glory for time was <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61860:16"/>conſequent after his death. <hi>We ſee him crowned</hi>] We ſee
him ſo by faith, with the eyes of our ſoule; and not by ſence, or the
eyes of our body; for, we beleeve it from the pregnant teſtimonies of the
holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures. <hi>That he by the grace of God ſhould
taſte death for every man:</hi>] To taſte death, is to dye for a little
time, as for a day or two, as Chriſt did: for, when we take but a little of a
thing, then we are ſaid to taſte of it. The final cauſe why Chriſt in
nature was for a little while a little lower then the Angels, was this, That he
might ſuffer death. And the ſuper-finall cauſe why he ſuffered death,
was this, That his death might be propitious and ſalutiferous to men. For the
glory of God, and the ſalvation of men required it, that the Prince of
ſalvation ſhould taſte of death to bring men to ſalvation, yea God had
ſo decreed. Now that he might bring men to ſalvation by this meanes, i. By
ſuffering of death, he muſt by nature be a mortall man, and not an Angel;
becauſe by nature, Angels are immortall, and naturally can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye. And the
efficient cauſe of both theſe ſubordinate finals of Chriſts dying, and
his dying for mens ſalvation, was the <hi>grace of God;</hi> the free love
and favour of God did beſtow this tranſcendent benefit upon men, that
Chriſt ſhould taſte death for them. For the Author had no ſooner made
open mention of Chriſts death, but preſently he addes the great and weighty
cauſes of it, both finall and efficient, leſt any man ſhould ſleight
it, and think it not a matter of ſuch moment, that therefore the Lord of the
faithfull ſhould be leſſe then the Angels for that end.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things, and
by whom are all things:</hi>] Theſe words are a circumlocution or a
deſignation of God, from his two great attributes of being the laſt end,
and the firſt cauſe of all things; and are introduced as a ground, whereby
to anſwer this tacit objection. Had it not beene farre more convenient and
decent, That Chriſt the Lord and King over Gods people, (though he were not
an Angell, but a man by nature mortall) ſhould not taſte of death and other
ſufferings, but alwaies remaine in his happineſſe and glory, as it became
the worth of ſo great a King. To this the Author anſwers, That it
wonderfully became God to proceed this way, and not to doe otherwiſe then he
did; becauſe this way did eſpecially ſuite to his end, and was a moſt
convenient meanes to attaine the end by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For God himſelfe is
the laſt end of all things, for whom all things are; and he is alſo the
firſt efficient of all things, from and by whom all things are; and therefore
it became God, who begins all things by himſelfe, and finiſheth them for
himſelfe, to apply ſuch meanes as are moſt conducent to his end; for, it
becomes the wiſeſt agent to worke moſt wiſely. The particle <hi>by
whom</hi>] notes not God as an inſtrumentall or meane cauſe, as if ſome
higher agent did worke by him; but ſuppoſeth him the principall and prime
agent; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61860:16"/>ſo, when it is uſed of God as
an efficient or agent of ſome thing. For that particle referred to God,
carries with it this force in ſence, that the thing mentioned, was not onely
primely invented and decreed by God, but by him alſo brought to iſſue by
effectuall meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from himſelfe, and not borrowed elſewhere.
This working of God, as being ſole Author and ſole meanes, is
diſtinguiſhed by Paul, by theſe two phraſes; Of him, and through him
are all things, Rom. 11.36. But by this Author both are compriſed in this
one, <hi>by whom are all things</hi>] And the univerſall particle <hi>all
things,</hi> muſt be reſtrained to his proper reſpective ſubject,
formerly mentioned, namely all things concerning the ſalvation of the
faithfull. <hi>In bringing many ſons unto glory:</hi>] Here is expreſſed
the intention or end, whereat God aymed, which was to bring many ſons unto
glory. The faithfull are the ſons of God in a double ſpirituall reſpect.
1. Of their ſpirituall birth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are regenerate, begotten and
borne of God, by the action of his holy Spirit upon them. 2. Of their
ſpirituall right, becauſe they are adopted or inſtituted to be the
univerſall heires of all his eſtate, by having the ſame right with
Chriſt, whereby they become and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his brethren. For in a rurall
ſence, he that hath a right to anothers eſtate, becomes his ſon. And the
eſtate whereto God brings them is <hi>glory;</hi> whereby is meant all that
future happineſſe and heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which eminently for the honour
of it is called glory, and which was myſtically underſtood, Pſal. 8.5.
and wherewith a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is ſaid to be crowned. And the ſons
brought to glory are <hi>many:</hi> not as many is a parcell oppoſed to all,
but as it is a multitude oppoſed to few; for, God hath ordained to bring to
glory not a few ſons, but a great many, even many multitudes. God is not as
man, who can have but a few ſons, and cannot bring each of them to all his
eſtate; but God hath many multitudes of ſons, and yet will bring each of
them to glory, even to all his whole eſtate. And therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile if
for ſo many ſons ſake, God would not ſpare their Captaine, whom he
might have ſpared partly, though not wholly, had their number beene but few.
<hi>To make the Captaine of their ſalvation perfect through
ſufferings:</hi>] Here is expreſſed the meane whereby God wrought his
end, in bringing a multitude of ſons to glory; namely, by giving them a
Captaine, and perfecting him through ſufferings. For, ſeeing God hath ſo
many ſons, or rather ſo many multitudes, therefore they being ſo great an
army, required a Captaine. Now Chriſt is the Captaine, or in moderne
language, the Generall over the army of the faithfull in two reſpects. 1. By
leading them in their journey, going before them in all their troubles and
afflictions. 2. By governing them as their head and Lord to command over them;
for, in an Army the Generall doth both lead and governe it. And he is the
Captaine <hi>of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> to the faithfull, becauſe he leads and
governes them in their <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61860:17"/>journey to ſalvation: that is, to
the eternall glory wherewith himſelfe is crowned, as before: which to them is
ſalvation, becauſe thereby they are ſafe, not only from deſtruction,
but from all affliction, and all other evils. And becauſe Chriſt is their
captain, by whom God brings them to ſalvation, &amp; by whom, God ſaves
them from death, therefore Chriſt is called and is their Saviour: <hi>And
Chriſt</hi> their captaine paſſed <hi>thorow ſufferings</hi>] whereby
is meant death, eſpecially a violent death, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing alſo all the
miſeries and evils that do precede and accompany it, through all which
ſufferings Chriſt paſſed, which therefore are called and are his
paſſion. <hi>And by theſe ſufferings Chriſt was made perfect.</hi>
His mortality was finiſhed and ended; and he being tranſlated to
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality was crowned with eternall glory and honour, as before; which was
his ultimate conſummation, and finall perfection, wherein nothing was wanting
to him, that might accrue to his ſupreme happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now ſeeing
therefore that this journey to ſalvation leads for the moſt part, through
divers calamities and afflictions, through death, and a violent death, did it
not become the wiſedome of God, that the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or captaine in this journey
ſhould paſſe through divers ſufferings, and death, yea a violent death,
before he could penetrate and arrive at the mark of eternall ſalvation, that
by his example hee might teach us, that this ſo rough and craggie way, which
ſeemes to precipate men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternall deſtruction, ſhould lead to the
higheſt tower of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by finiſhing our mortality, and
perfecting us into immortalitie. And did it not become the wiſdome of God,
that he, into whoſe hand God had put the ſalvation of all his ſons, and
whom he would ordaine for their high Prieſt, ſhould in all things be made
like unto his brethren, and taſte of the ſame cup of ſufferings with
them, that being himſelfe acquainted with ſufferings, he might learne to
ſuccour them in theirs.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are
ſanctified, are all of one.</hi>] Here he ſhewes the great alliance
betweene Chriſt and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and what good cauſe there is, why not
onely Chriſt, but alſo the faithfull are ſtiled by the name of the
ſonnes of God, ſeeing Chriſt and they have the ſame parentage, and come
as it were from one ſtocke. And he ſeems to deliver it as a generall rule,
that the ſanctifier, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified are all of one. i. draw their
originall from one perſon, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created from one and the ſame Father. To
ſanctifie, is to expiate or purge away ſinne; and to be ſanctified is to
have their ſinnes expiated or purged away; for as ſinne doth pollute and
prophane us: ſo Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſanctifie and hallow us. And in this
ſence the word ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is often taken in Scripture, eſpecially by
this Author. Now Chriſt is he that doth ſanctifie; for hee doth expiate or
purge away our ſinnes: and the faithfull are they that are ſanctified; for
by Chriſt their ſinnes are expiated or purged away. And therefore Chriſt
and the faithfull are all of one linage and parentage; for hee and they 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61860:17"/>draw their originall from one perſon, even from God who
is the common Father to them both; and conſequently Chriſt and the
faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full make up betweene themſelves, but as it were one nation or one
people under God; and conſequently againe, he and they are brethren one to
another. An example hereof was under the Law among the Hebrews, to whom this
Author writes, and to whom therefore this rule of union and fraternitie, by
meanes of ſanctification was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known. For among them the high
Prieſt was he, that did ſanctifie the people by expiating and purging away
their ſinnes, making atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God for them: and the people were they who
were ſanctified, by being expiated and purged from their ſinnes; And both
Prieſt and people were of the ſame nation, ſprung from Jacob, who was one
common Father to them; whereupon they uſed to call one another brethren. In
like manner the caſe ſtands between Chriſt who is the high Prieſt to
ſanctifie; and the faithfull who are Gods people to be ſanctified; as we
have already declared it. <hi>For which cauſe hee is not aſhamed to call
them brethren.</hi>] Indeed this cauſe is very pregnant to make this
conſequent to follow upon it. For ſeeing that Chriſt and the faithfull
are all of one God, as of one common Father, therefore they are the brethren of
Chriſt; and Chriſt is not aſhamed to call them ſo: for all children
proceeding from one common Father are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſhould not be aſhamed
to call one another ſo. Indeed, the condition of the faithfull is in this
life ſo contemptible and ſhamefull, that Chriſt might think it a ſhame
to him, to have ſuch brethren. In which ſence this Author ſaith
afterward, chap. 11. 16. That God was not aſhamed to be called the God of
Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob. For how vile are thoſe Patriarks compared to
God, the Soveraigne Lord of all things, eſpecially then being rotted to
duſt for ſo many ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So all Chriſtians how vile and wretched
are they, how poore, contemned, and deſpiſed? inſomuch that Chriſt now
ſo great a King, of ſo great Majeſtie and glory, might juſtly
diſdaine to call ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures his brethren: but Chriſt is not
aſhamed either to acknowledge them his brethren, or to call them by the name
of brethren.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Saying, I will declare thy Name unto my brethren;
in the midſt of the Church will I ſing praiſe unto thee.</hi>] By three
Teſtimonies out of Scripture, hee proves that Chriſt is not aſhamed to
call the faithfull, brethren. The firſt Teſtimony is taken from Pſal.
22.22. The lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſence is; David was King over the people of Iſrael;
yet hee calls them his brethren, and when God had ſaved him from death, he
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to praiſe God in their company, in the midſt of the
Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or aſſemby. The myſticall ſence is, Chriſt is a King
over the faithfull, yet hee calls the faithfull his brethren; and when God had
raiſed and ſaved him from death, he appeared to his diſciples where they
were congregated, and in the middeſt of their aſſembly, he really 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61860:18"/>declared the power of God in raiſing him from the dead;
and with out all doubt, did celebrate the Name of God with words of praiſe
and thankſgiving. For hence it is we read, John 20.17. That Chriſt after
his Reſurrection, willed Mary to goe unto his brethren, and ſay of him; I
aſcend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God. In which
words he gives the reaſon, why he calls them his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; namely, becauſe
he and they had one common God and Father.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>And againe, I will put my truſt in him.</hi>]
The ſecond Teſtimony to prove the former point, is taken (as I conceive)
out of Pſal. 91.2. becauſe that Pſalme is ſo frequently applyed to
Chriſt, though this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony be extant in ſeverall other places. The
literall ſence: David makes God his God, and confidence, to put his truſt
in him, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, <hi>will</hi> put his truſt in him. The literall
ſence: Chriſt in like manner made God his God and confidence to truſt in
him, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to truſt in him. For before his Reſurrection, when
he hanged on the Croſſe, he ſaid, My God, my God, Why haſt thou
forſaken me? Which words argue no deſpaire, but a confident and
perſevering truſt in God, that though God did ſeeme to forſake him, yet
he ſhould be his God; and hee would truſt in him. Yea, the Prieſts and
Scribes mocked at his confidence and truſt in God, Matth. 27.43. And after
his Reſurrection, he calls God his God; in the place precited, Joh. 20.17.
But now the Quere will be, what this makes to the purpoſe of proving the
faithfull to be the brethren of Chriſt. The anſwer is; It proves it
directly, though not immediatly; For ſeeing Chriſt and the faithfull, have
God for their God, and for their confidence to put their truſt in him;
therefore he and the faithfull <hi>are of one.</hi>] i. are confidents and
dependents upon one and the ſame God and Father; and by means of that they
muſt needs be brethren, as was before concluded, upon verſe 11. So this
teſtimony proves their unitie in God; and their unity in God, proves their
fraternity betweene themſelves: For when the firſt truth is the reaſon of
the ſecond, it is alſo the reaſon of all other truths, whereof the
ſecond is the reaſon. <hi>And again; Behold, I and the children which God
hath given me;</hi>]. The third Teſtimony to prove the former point taken
from Eſai. 8.18. The literall ſence: God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Prophet children;
and he and they were brethren in this, that they were to be for ſignes and
wonders; and were ſo appointed to be from God. The myſticall ſence;
Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and the faithfull are the children of God, Gods
<hi>poſt-nati</hi> after Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the brethren of
Chriſt. And God hath given them unto Chriſt, by bringing them to beleeve in
Chriſt, and committing them to the care of Chriſt; See John 6.39.40. and
John 17.6,7. And by giving him power to give them eternall life, Joh 17.2. For
hee did predeſtinate them to be conformed to the image of Chriſt, that
Chriſt might be the firſt-borne among many brethren, Rom. 8.29. And 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61860:18"/>Chriſt and the faithfull are brethren in being ſignes
and wonders. For Chriſt was for a ſigne which ſhould be ſpoken
againſt, Luke 2.34. And the Apoſtles were made a ſpectacle to the world,
unto angels, and to men, 1. Cor. 49. yet the faithfull are not the ſonnes of
God, before they be given to Chriſt and beleeve in him; for by faith they are
made the ſonnes of God: But as ſoone as a man is given to Chriſt, then
hee becomes the ſon of God; and unleſſe he be ſo given, he cannot be
the ſon of God. See John 6.44,45.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>For as much then as the children are partakers of
fleſh and bloud</hi>] After the Author had taught us, the neere alliance of
brotherhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the faithfull; he now ſhews what is the
ſtate and condition of the faithfull, that from thence he might conclude,
that Chriſt alſo their Captaine and high Prieſt, muſt needs have the
like condition with them. And ſo returnes to what he had ſaid at the ninth
verſe before, That Chriſt was made a little lower then the Angels,
expreſſing here the impulſive cauſe of that lowneſſe. <hi>By
fleſh and bloud</hi>] Here is underſtood, an infirme, fraile, and ruinous
nature and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubject to divers evils, even to death and corruption.
Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition, the faithfull, who are Gods children, are all
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers. <hi>He alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame:</hi>]
Therefore Chriſt alſo, the Captaine and high Prieſt of the faithfull, to
whom he was ſo neerely allyed, as to be their brother, did himſelfe alſo
in the very ſame manner partake of the very ſame nature and condition of
fleſh and bloud, to be as infirme, fraile and ruinous as they, ſubject to
as many miſeries as they, even to death and corruption; For, he ſuffered
death actually, and was by nature ſubject to corruption, yet he ſuffered
not corruption actually; for God by his power and by his grace reſcued him
from it, and would not ſuffer his holy One to ſee corruption. Acts 2.27.
The ſumme of the Reaſoning is: Seeing Chriſt muſt be the Captaine and
high Prieſt of mortall and fraile men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt not be Angel, but
lower then the Angels, even a mortall and fraile man like his brethren,
ſubject to divers ſufferings, even to death it ſelfe. But the Incarnation
of Chriſt cannot be concluded from theſe laſt words; for, then by the
ſame reaſon, the Incarnation of the faithfull (or the reſt of Gods
children) muſt needs be concluded from the former, ſeeing Chriſt is
ſaid to partake of fleſh and bloud likewiſe, or in like manner with them.
But ſeeing the faithfull, the reſt of Gods children are not incarnate, no
more is Chriſt their Captaine and high Prieſt; otherwiſe betweene
Chriſt and the reſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there muſt be a great difference
and unlikeneſſe, in that wherein they are here concluded to be moſt
ſemblant and alike, namely in their partaking of fleſh and bloud. And
granting the Incarnation here, then from the death of Chriſt and his
Reſurrection following it, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cannot take an example of their
reſurrection or immortality after <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61860:19"/>death, by death to be
acquired; and therefore by the death of Chriſt, cannot be delivered from the
feare of death, as the Author inferres it in the verſe next following.
<hi>That through death he might deſtroy the Devill.</hi>] The finall cauſe
to what end Chriſt did partake of a mortall condition, and of death it
ſelfe, whereby he was lower then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is here expreſſed to be
double; whereof notwithſtanding one end is dependent and conſequent from
the other. The firſt is, That by his death he might deſtroy the devill.
Chriſt by his death deſtroyes not the devill for his perſon; for, the
devill by his perſon is an angell, and therefore by nature indeſtructible,
incorruptible, and immortall. But, Chriſt by his death deſtroyes the devill
for his power; he aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and abrogates the kingdome and power that Satan
hath in the world, particularly his power of death; and therefore he
deſcribes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan by this circumlocution, <hi>him that had the power of
death.</hi>] The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Satan conſiſts in this, that he detaines men
mancipated to his command, and enſlaved at his beck, moſt obſequious to
commit any ſinne; from the yoake of which ſlavery, they have of
themſelves no meanes to pull their necke. This power is by an Hebraiſme
called the power of death. i. a mortiferous or deadly power, becauſe Satan by
ſin brings men to death, and that death is eternall to them. Chriſt
therefore ſuffered death, that he might overthrow the tyranny of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
breaking all his forces, that he might take from this power of holding men in
deadly bondage, and deliver them from it. For hence it is that we are ſaid to
be delivered from the power of Satan. See Acts 26.18. and Col. 1.13. And it is
by the death of Chriſt, that Satan is ſaid to be deveſted and ſpoiled
of all his dominion and power. See John 12.31,33. and Col. 2.15. Now the
reaſon why Chriſt deſtroyes the deadly power of Satan by his death is,
Becauſe Chriſt by his death hath obtained the ſupreame power over all
things, whereby he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to maſter all his enemies (whereof Satan is
the head) firſt, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their forces; and laſt, utterly deſtroying
them. This way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Satans deadly power, if we reſpect the nature
of the action, though Chriſt might have done it without his death: yet it was
ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the decree and counſell of God, that it ſhould not be
effected, but by the meanes of his death; and that for the ſecond end of his
death, which is expreſſed in the next verſe following; namely, to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them who through feare of death, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And deliver them who through feare of death, were
all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>] The ſecond or ſubordinate
end of Chriſts death, is to vindicate men from a fearefull bondage. This
ſervitude or bondage, is the feare of death, and of eternall death, or as it
may bee feared, to laſt eternally; for, as it is the manner of ſlaves to
feare, ſo feare it ſelfe is a fearefull ſlavery; hence S. Paul termes it
the ſpirit of bondage, Rom. 8.15. And they are ſubject to this ſlavery of
feare, not <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61860:19"/>who ſtand in actuall fear, but who are liable
to fear, or by right ought to fear. Hence it plainly appeares, that all they
who fear death, have no ſhare in this deliverance or libertie by Chriſt,
but remaine in a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſlavery. And all they are forced to fear death,
and the eternitie of it, who have not a ſure hope of their Reſurrection.
And how grievous this ſlavery or bondage of it is, appeares from the duration
of it, in that it continues upon men <hi>all the time of their life.</hi>] No
minute of their life is free from the fear of it; for though every minute they
doe not actually fear it, yet every minute they are ſubject to fear, and may
juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear it. From this ſlaviſh fear of death, Chriſt hath delivered
men by his death, while by his death, he not onely paſſed to an immortall
life, but alſo obtained power to repreſſe and deſtroy the power of
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Hence Chriſt ſaith to John. Fear not, I am the firſt and the
laſt; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore,
and have the keys of hell and of death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.17.18. For what man
now will fear death to be his eternall undoing, when he ſees a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from death with a moſt glorious iſſue, if he imitate Chriſt; when he
ſees that the forces of his enemy, who before oppreſſed him, and
enthralled to eternall death, are no longer to be feared, but are broken and
deſtroyed by him, who himſelf under-went a bloody death? And hence it
further appeares, that with the death of Chriſt here, wee muſt joyne his
Reſurrection; for that wee might no longer fear death, Chriſt muſt needs
not only ſuffer death, but muſt againe be raiſed from death. For if
Chriſt be not raiſed, our faith is vaine; we are yet in our ſins, and the
dead in Chriſt are periſhed, 1. Cor. 15.17,18.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>For no where he taketh hold of Angels.</hi>] Here
he confirmes the doctrine delivered at the ninth verſe; That Chriſt was not
made in the nature of an Angel, but was made a little lower then the Angels,
for the ſuffering of death. Why ſo? The reaſon is here laid downe;
becauſe Chriſt was not ordained, to ſuccour and help the Angels, who by
nature are immortall and die not; and therefore need not be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured or
holpen from death. <hi>For no where,</hi>] There is no teſtimonie or
authority extant in Scripture, whereon to ground this: for it is no where
ſaid, that he takes hold of Angels to help them. <hi>Taketh hold</hi>] The
word in the originall <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies
properly to take a man with thy hand, either to lead him ſome whither, or to
uphold him, thereby to help him. See Mark 8.23. and Luke 9.47. and Luke 14.4.
Hence figuratively it is tranſlated to ſignifie ſuccouring or helping.
For when we would help one from falling or ſinking under ſome burden, or
would raiſe him being fallen, then wee put our hand to him and take hold of
him. Hence it is ſaid of Wiſdome that ſhe exalteth her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and layeth hold of them that
ſeeketh her, i. ſhee helpeth or aideth them that ſeeke her. And there is
the ſame ſence of the counterverbe
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; becauſe when we would help a
man up <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61860:20"/>with his burden, we take hold of it over againſt
him. And this ſence of the word is explicated afterward by the Author, at the
laſt verſe of this Chapter; for, what he calls here <hi>taking hold
of,</hi> there he expreſſeth by the word <hi>ſuccouring;</hi> That
Chriſt ſuffering himſelfe, being tempted, is able to ſuccour them that
are tempted; for, in both theſe verſes he treates of the ſame thing, and
the reaſon of the conſequence propoſed in this verſe is explicated in
that. Thus for the ſence of the word; now for the ſence of it. It is not of
the preter-tenſe, as if referred to a time paſt, particularly to that time,
when (as it is at the ninth verſe before) Chriſt was made a little lower
then the Angels: for at that time, being the time of his birth, he did neither
help Angels nor men: but it is of the preſent tenſe, he taketh not hold; in
reference to the time of his death, upon which the Author groundeth all this
argument; For, by his death he deſtroyes the devill, and delivers men from
the feare of death; What is the reaſon of that? Becauſe, by his death he
taketh not hold of Angels to help and ſuccour them, or deliver them from the
feare of death, who being immortall by nature cannot feare it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can
here be any enallage of the preſent tenſe for the preter, but rather of the
preſent for the future; Chriſt was made lower then the Angels; Why ſo?
Becauſe by his death he was not to take hold of the Angels, to help and
ſuccour them from the feare of it. Now, both this ſenſe, and this
ſenſe of the word was well perceived by our laſt Tranſlators of the
Bible into Engliſh; for, they have noted it in the margent of this verſe,
though in the Text they correſpond with ſome other Tranſlations. Hence it
plainly appeares, how theſe words are miſtaken by ſome Tranſlators and
Interpreters, who from hence would ſhew, that Chriſt tooke not on him the
nature of Angels, which aſſertion, though it be in it ſelfe moſt true,
yet it cannot be the meaning of this place. For, 1. It is againſt the ſence
of the words, whereof there are but two, and it goes againſt the ſence of
them both. For, to apprehend or take hold of a thing, cannot ſignifie to
aſſume or take on us the nature of it. And the word Angels in the plurall
number cannot imply an aſſumption of their nature, for then it muſt have
beene An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in the ſingular. 2. It is againſt the context or reaſoning
of the Author, who could not, nor ought not to take that for an argument or a
reaſon, which by argument and reaſon he was to prove; for, no one and the
ſame truth can be an argument or a reaſon to it ſelfe why it ſelfe
ſhould be true. At the ſeventh verſe before, this truth is laid downe,
That Chriſt tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but was made lower;
whereof, how can a reaſon be given by this, that he tooke not on him the
nature of Angels, ſeeing theſe two ſayings are identicall, whereof
neither can be the cauſe or reaſon of the other? But, if we underſtand
theſe words of not helping or ſuccouring the Angels, then all things cohere
moſt elegantly and rationally, thus. <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61860:20"/>Chriſt tooke not
the nature of Angels, but was made lower then them, becauſe by his death he
was not to help or ſuccour the Angels from feare of death, but to ſuccour a
creature lower then they, who is all his liſe in bondage of death, and
ſubject to the feare of death. <hi>But hee tooke hold of the ſeed of
Abraham:</hi>] That Chriſt ſhould helpe the Angels is <hi>no where</hi>
ſaid in Scripture; <hi>but</hi> it is ſaid in ſome one or ſeverall
places of Scripture, that hee was ordained to take hold of the ſeed of
Abraham, to helpe and ſuccour it: For to <hi>take hold</hi> in this clauſe
of the verſe, carries the very ſame ſence that it did in the former,
where it was denyed of the Angels. The word ſeed, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the
Hebrews, is for the moſt part a Noune collective, and ſignifies a multitude
of perſons; and therefore the Author fitly uſeth the word ſeed, importing
a multitude, that he might oppoſe it, to the Angels in the plurall number.
And the ſeed of Abraham, are the children or poſterity of Abraham, whether
they be carnall by birth onely, or ſpirituall by faith onely, or both by
birth and faith. And he rather ſaid the ſeed of Abraham in two reſpects.
1. Becauſe we often reade in Scripture, that Chriſt is promiſed to no
other men properly, but to the poſterity of Abraham, or at leaſt to his
ſeed, chiefly and in the firſt place. 2. Becauſe this word would be
moſt pleaſing to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, to whom he writes, who were themſelves the
ſeed, or poſterity of Abraham. But, by this ambiguous appellation, which
might ſignifie the ſeed of Abraham, whether carnall or ſpirituall, he
ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiates the Hebrews, that withall he might tacitely invite them, to
continue Chriſtians; becauſe, Chriſtians onely, of what Nation ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be, are the ſpirituall ſeed of Abraham, Gal. 3.29. For, Chriſt was
deſtinate to take hold of, to help, ſuccour, and ſave onely that
ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſeed, as being their onely mercifull and faithfull high
Prieſt. And by the words here, we muſt underſtand rather the ſpirituall
ſeed of Abraham, then the carnall: but they that are his ſeed both wayes,
both carnally and ſpiritually, as theſe Hebrewes were, may challenge
Chriſt in a manner by a double right, to be their ayder and helper. The
ſumme of all is. As in the former clauſe of this verſe, the Author
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the negative, That Chriſt was not made an Angel, becauſe he was not
to take hold of them, to help and ſuccour them: So in this clauſe he proves
the affirmative, why he was made lower then the Angels, why he tooke part of
fleſh and bloud: Becauſe by his death he was to take hold of the ſeed of
Abraham, to help and ſuccour the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in delivering them from the
feare and bondage of death. So the words ſhew, not what Chriſt <hi>was</hi>
by his birth, but what he <hi>did</hi> by his death. Hence now it plainly
appeares how incongruouſly theſe words are wreſted, to Chriſts taking
on him humane nature. For, this ſence is contrary to the context, and
altogether croſſe to right reaſoning; for, by it the ſame truth is made
a reaſon whereby to conclude it ſelfe. <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61860:21"/>At the
fourteenth verſe before, this is laid downe for a truth, That Chriſt tooke
part of our fleſh and bloud, i. he did partake of humane nature; of which
truth, how can a reaſon be given by this, that hee tooke on him our humane
nature, ſeeing theſe two truths are identicall, though not in words, yet
altogether in ſence? But if we underſtand theſe words of helping and
ſuccouring the faithfull, then there runs a veine of evident reaſoning.
Chriſt was made lower then the Angels, and tooke part of fleſh and bloud;
to what end? that he might ſuffer death: Why ſo? To deſtroy the Devils
power of death. Why that? Becauſe he was to deliver men from the feare and
bondage of death: Why did he that? Becauſe he was to take hold of men, to
helpe and ſuccour them who are the ſeed of Abraham.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Wherefore in all things</hi>] Hitherto he hath
ſhewed that Chriſt muſt be a mortall man, to ſuffer death; now from the
laſt cauſe of his helping or ſuccouring men, he teacheth that he muſt
not onely be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but ſubject to divers afflictions; and not onely
ſubject, but actual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer them, and that not ſome few, but even
all wherewith the reſt of the faithfull are afflicted. <hi>It behooved him,
to be made like unto his brethren</hi>] How, and why the faithfull are the
brethren of Chriſt, hath before beene ſhewed and proved. Yet, in this place
againe the word brethren carries a powerfull force of reaſoning. It behooveth
a brother to helpe and ſuccour his brother; and Chriſt therefore takes hold
of the faithfull, to help and ſuccour them, becauſe they are his brethren;
eſpecially the ſeed of Abraham, who are his brethren, both by God and man.
And it behooveth alſo a brother to be like a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the more alike
they are, the more lovely they are to all, and the more loving one to another.
And therefore it behooved Chriſt to be made like unto his brethren, not onely
in ſome one thing, as in their nature, to be made a little lower then the
Angels, as his brethren were, or to take part of fleſh and bloud as they did;
but alſo to be like them <hi>in all things,</hi> even in their whole
condition, to be ſubject to afflictions and temptations as they are, and
actually to ſuffer all ſorts of them as they doe; yet he was not like them
in ſin, for that is excepted, Heb. 4.15. and a univerſall ſaying muſt
alwayes abate, when a particular excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is expreſly made againſt it.
<hi>That he might be a mercifull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full high Prieſt.</hi>] Chriſt
muſt be made like unto his brethren in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he might be their high
Prieſt; for, the Prieſt and the people muſt be of one Nation; he that
ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, muſt be all of one: and he was
made like them in condition for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring afflictions, and therefore he
muſt bee unto them a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt. 1. He muſt be
<hi>mercifull,</hi> to be touched with a ſence of his brethrens miſeries
and ſorrowes; and to thinke them ſo his owne or ſo neere him, that he may
be moved readily to ſuccour or help them as himſelfe. For, mercy is a
ſorrow for anothers miſery, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61860:21"/>moving us to ſuccour him.
2. He muſt be <hi>faithfull,</hi> to adminiſter and performe all things
with all care and diligence in their behalfe, that concernes their
ſanctifying or ſuccouring; to expiate their ſins, and help them from
miſery. And this faithfulneſſe takes ſome roote and growth from
mercifulneſſe; for mercy doth beget and nouriſh faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Now
that Chriſt might be truly mercifull and faithfull to his brethren in all
things, therefore he muſt bee made like them in all things, even in all their
afflictions and ſorrowes. <hi>In things pertaining to God:</hi>] The office
of the high Prieſt in generall was this; to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in things
pertaining to God, as to offer gifts and ſacrifices for ſin: (as the Author
explicates it afterward, chap. 5.1.) And it was peculiar and proper to the high
Prieſt, to expiate or make atonement for the ſins of the whole people
together; and not of ſingle perſons by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for that was common
to other Prieſts. This popular Expiation was performed by Chriſt our high
Prieſt, when after the ſhedding of his bloud on earth he entred into
heaven, as into the Sanctuary or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all, there to appeare in the
preſence of God, to make Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us; that is, that reſting in
heaven with God, he might admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and performe all things, that concernes
our deliverance from the puniſhments of our ſins. <hi>To make
reconciliation for the ſins of the people</hi>] The end of the office of the
high Prieſt was, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people. i. To
propitiate or expiate their ſinnes. The word in the originall ſignifies to
cover; hence the cover of the Arke was called the propitiatory, becauſe it
covered the Tables of the Law that lay in the Arke; and was a figure of Gods
mercy, whereby he was propitious to forgive, or cover the ſins againſt the
Law. For ſins are no other way propitiated or expiated, then as it were by
covering or hiding, that they may no more appeare againſt us in the ſight
of God. Hence Gods people are ſaid to be reconciled unto God; that is, to be
ſanctified and purged from their ſins; for, when the Tabernacle was
ſanctified and purged from the ſins of the people, it was called
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling, Levit. 16.20. And, hence God is ſaid to be propitiated or
pacified, or appeaſed; not as if hereby he were alwayes turned from anger
which was in him before, but many times, that he ſhould not deſiſt from
being propitious, but continue pacified or appeaſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; and that he
ſhould paſſe by juſt cauſes of anger which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he might
have. For, thus God was anciently pacified by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ordained by his
Law; for, it is no way likely, that God was really angry with his people for
thoſe ſins, for which he granted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation under the Law, then when the
people procured the timely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of their ſinnes, according to the
preſcript of Gods Law, then certainely God was not actually angry; for then
God muſt be angry at ſet times of the yeare yearely, at every ſolemnity
of the Expiation. By thoſe ſacrifices therefore God was not pacified, by
being drawne from <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61860:22"/>anger; but thereby order was taken, that
God might ſtill continue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and not turne away his grace and favour
from his people, by reaſon of their ſinnes. Hence it appeares, that from
theſe words of Reconciling, and Pacifying, we muſt not conclude that Gods
wrath againſt us was appeaſed by Chriſt: but when we heare theſe words
referred unto ſinnes, we muſt thereby underſtand nothing elſe, but
their expiation or purgation made by Chriſt; as this Author termed it before,
chap. 1. v. 3. But, how Chriſt now reſiding in heaven, and exerciſing the
office of his Prieſthood, doth purge away our ſins, ſhall be declared
hereafter; namely, no other way then by the power God hath granted him to
forgive them, that we ſhould not be puniſhed and periſh eternally for
them. The faithfull are the people of God, who are reconciled, and whoſe
ſins are expiated. And this, as was noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was proper to the office
of the high Prieſt, who uſed not to make reconciliation for ſingle
perſons, but for the people on the day of Expiation.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>For in that he himſelfe hath ſuffered, being
tempted</hi>] He ſaith not ſimply that Chriſt hath ſuffered, but he
addes being tempted. The ſufferings of Chriſt were not puniſhments but
temptations or trials of his excellent fidelity and piety. For, there was no
ſinne in Chriſt for which he ſhould be puniſhed, ſeeing puniſhments
are onely for ſinne. And therefore chap. 4. v. 15. ſpeaking of Chriſts
being tempted or tried, he expreſly addeth, that he was without ſinne, i.
his triall was not a puniſhment, as no way merited by ſin. <hi>He is able
to ſuccour them that are tempted</hi>] Afflictions to the faithfull are
temptations of their faith and righteouſneſſe; whether they will
perſevere in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, or be beaten off by worldly calamities:
as the offering of Iſaac was a temptation to Abraham; and our whole
ſpirituall warfare againſt Satan, the world, and the fleſh, is a daily
temptation or triall of us. In theſe their trials Chriſt doth ſuccour
them, by his aſſiſtance of them from periſhing under the miſeries
that preſſe them. And this he doth, when he affords them ſtrength and
courage to ſuſtaine the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, leſt by force thereof they fall
from the faith and forſake it. Or when he ſo moderates the afflictions,
that they be not too great, for paine, or too long for time, by lightning of
them if they be too or ſhortening them if they be too long; or, laſtly,
when he receives their ſpirits at their death, to reſtore them againe in
due time with ſupreame glory. And when Chriſt ſuccours the faithfull in
this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he doth even thereby expiate their ſinnes. For thereby he
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and provides with all care, leſt that ſinking under their
afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or being deſtitute at their death, they ſhould by this meanes
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer puniſhment for their ſinnes. And therefore the word <hi>able to
help</hi>] muſt be ampliated and extended, to be both able, willing and
carefull, for otherwiſe he ſhould not be a mercifull and faithfull high
Prieſt; if <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61860:22"/>having power to ſuccour, he had neither will
nor care to performe it. Hence appeare three verities. 1. That Chriſt our
high Prieſt expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth our ſinnes, by ſuccouring us in our temptations.
2. That the principall function of his Prieſtly office is performed now in
heaven; and was not performed at this death, wherein there was only a
prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toward it. 3. That neither the Prieſtly function of Chriſt,
nor his Expiation of ſins thereby procured, conſiſt in this, that
Chriſt ſhould ſuffer puniſhment for our ſins, ſeeing that can have
no place in heaven.</p>

ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hitherto concerning the dignity of Chriſt; who ſeeing hee is ſo
excellent a perſon as yee have heard, therefore ye have great reaſon to
conſider him well. <hi>Holy brethren,</hi>] Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the prophane
vulgar and worldly, by your knowledge in divine myſteries; and allied to me,
not by a vulgar and carnall fraternitie: but by a ſpirituall affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in
Chriſt. <hi>Partakers of the heavenly calling.</hi>] Who together with 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61860:23"/>me and all other Chriſtians have one common ſpirituall
calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are called. And this calling is called heavenly, not only
becauſe it was notified from heaven, and comes from thence: but alſo
becauſe it is directive to heaven to teach us the way thither; and conductive
to heaven to carry us ſafely thither: So that heaven is the double terme of
our ſpirituall calling; for heaven is the ſtart of it from whence it
runnes, and the marke of it whereto it runnes. <hi>Conſider Ieſus
Chriſt</hi>] Ye ſix your mindes and hearts upon Moſes, to conſider him
in all particulars; conſider alſo Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Apoſtle and
high Prieſt of our profeſsion.</hi>] Our profeſſion is our Religion,
whereby we profeſſe to ſerve God and to be ſaved. Of this our Religion
Chriſt is the great Prophet, the grand Apoſtle, Emiſſary or Legate, or
the firſt Meſſenger of it; becauſe he was the firſt that was ſent
from God, to bring it into the world, and to publiſh or preach it unto men.
For every Prophet ſent with a meſſage immediatly from God, is therefore
an Apoſtle. And of this our Religion, Chriſt is the high Prieſt, or
chiefe Preſident to order it: becauſe he perpetually adminiſters and
officiates all things pertaining to it; and becauſe by him all the
profeſſors of it, have their acceſſe to God; becauſe hee expiates and
purgeth away their ſins; and becauſe hee takes care that all things
pertaining to divine worſhip, be rightly performed in the Temple of God,
dedicate to this Religion; For in this place, the Author remarkably calls
Chriſt by the name of high Prieſt, becauſe anciently the high Prieſts
were Preſidents over the Temple and holy things of God. From both theſe
offices, thus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt, appears his tranſcendent dignity. For
anciently there was an Apoſtle or Prophet of the Jewiſh Religion, who was
Moſes, for he firſt taught and publiſhed it: but then among them there
was another high Prieſt, who was Aaron and his Succeſſors. But Chriſt
alone in one perſon was both the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our
profeſſion. But in this place we muſt ampliate &amp; extend the word high
Prieſt ſo largely, that it may alſo comprehend the Regall dignity or
office of Chriſt. For it is not likely that the Author in this breviate of
Chriſts offices would wholly omit the chiefeſt, eſpecially in this place,
where hee would move them to conſider Chriſt; eſpecially when he had
before tearmed him ſuch a high Prieſt, as was able to ſuccour them that
are tempted: which thing belongs alſo to his Regall power, and had in the
firſt chapter ſo lively expreſſed his Regall dignity, by ſeverall
teſtimonies of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Who was faithfull to him that appointed him.</hi>]
It had been enough to move the Hebrewes to conſider Chriſt, by what the
Author had delivered before, in preferring him above the Angels, by ſeverall
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of reaſon, and teſtimonies of Scripture: but the Author not
content with this, doth here ſingle out Moſes, and equall Chriſt with
him; becauſe the Hebrewes had Moſes in high eſteeme, oppoſing him 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61860:23"/>to Chriſt, and preferring him before Chriſt. The
particular wherein he equals Chriſt with Moſes, is the faithfulneſſe of
Chriſt, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth the rather in this particular, becauſe that
when God gave a ſingular commendation of Moſes, the Lord inſtanced in the
particular, of his faithfulneſſe to God. He therefore declares that
Chriſt was as faithfull to God as ever Moſes was. Now the faithfulneſſe
of Chriſt relates to both his offices, of high Legate, (or Apoſtle) and
high Prieſt. The faithfulneſſe of a Legate conſiſts in theſe two
things. 1. That he deliver his Meſſage wholly and truly, according to his
Commiſſion. 2. That he uſe all meanes to perſwade and gaine faith to
his Meſſage; eſpecially if he be thereto enjoyned by him that ſent him.
And the faithfulneſſe of a high Prieſt is, To provide all things
pertinent to the worſhip of God; and then to propitiate God toward thoſe
that worſhip him. The perſon to whom Chriſt was thus faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, was the
ſupreme God, who made him his Legate and high Prieſt, by appointing him to
the execution of theſe offices, wherein he might exerciſe his ſingular
faithfulneſſe; for Chriſt aſſumed not theſe offices of himſelfe,
but was thereto appointed of God the Father; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more fully. <hi>As
alſo Moſes was faithfull in all his houſe.</hi>] Moſes was a great
Prophet and Legate ſent from God; in ſo much that when Aaron and Miriam had
ſpoken againſt him, the Lord to publiſh his great eſteeme of him, would
vindicate him by his owne mouth, and thereupon preferres him before all other
Prophets, in that he would deale more familiarly with him then with any other;
for, he would ſpeake to others by viſions and dreames, and dark ſpeeches;
but he would ſpeake to Moſes mouth to mouth, even apparently, and he
ſhould behold the ſimilitude of the Lord; of which dealing with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Lord gives this reaſon, becauſe Moſes was faithfull in all the Lords
houſe, Numb. 12.6,7,8. In which words, who ſees not how highly God
eſteemed Moſes above all other Prophets? Now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take houſe for
Gods Tabernacle, or for his family; yet Moſes was moſt faithfull in both
reſpects, in that he neglected nothing that pertained to the care and good of
either. The ſumme is: Leſt by this ſingular teſtimony given by God to
Moſes for his faithfulneſſe, any man ſhould hereby thinke, that herein
Moſes was greater then Chriſt; therefore the Author adornes Chriſt with
the very ſame commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faithfulneſſe that God had given to
Moſes; that thereby hee might take from Moſes all prerogative of his being
above Chriſt in any thing, and conſequently inferres Chriſt equall to
Moſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For this man was counted worthy of more glory then
Moſes</hi>] Having ſhewed that Chriſt was no way inferiour to Moſes;
here he advanceth a degree higher, and affirmes that Chriſt was much
ſuperiour to Moſes, and counted worthy of more honour, that he might
further move them to the conſideration of Chriſt. And yet more
determinately, that the <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61860:24"/>honour of Chriſt is a great
diſtance above that of Moſes. And the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words ſhew how much:
<hi>As much as he who hath builded the houſe, hath more honour then the
houſe.</hi>] He properly builds the houſe that either frameth it
himſelfe, or cauſeth it to be framed for himſelfe; for, whoſoever is
the owner, is properly the builder, and not the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, who is hired to
build it for another. Now the builder is more honourable then the building;
for, the Builder by his building be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Lord or Owner of it; which is the
firſt originall or naturall ground of honour. And looke how much the builder
is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then the building, though the degree be never ſo
indefinite: ſo much is Chriſt more honourable then Moſes. For, Moſes
was but a part of the building in Gods family; but Chriſt under God is the
buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his whole Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For, every houſe is builded by ſome man:</hi>]
No houſe doth raiſe or build it ſelfe, but is built or raiſed by ſome
perſon or other, who builds it himſelfe for himſelfe, or cauſeth it to
be builded for himſelfe. <hi>But he that hath built all things is God.</hi>]
Here he expreſſeth what perſon he underſtands for the architect or
builder of the houſe, whereof he ſpeakes; namely, that he meanes God
himſelfe. Hence it appeares that the Authors minde was to ſay, That
Chriſt is ſo much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then Moſes, as God is more honourable
then his houſe which he hath built; that is, then his people, who are the
houſe of God. For, as Moſes muſt be joyned with the houſe of God,
whereof he was a principall part: ſo Chriſt muſt be joyned with God, who
joyntly with God hath built his houſe, and exerciſeth dominion or
Lordſhip over it. So that Chriſt this way conſidered is not a part of the
building, but a part of the builder, and therefore above the building.
Furthermore, if the difference in dignity betweene Chriſt and Moſes be the
ſame that is betweene God and his houſe; then conſequently there will be
alſo the ſame proportion in dignity betweene God and Chriſt, that there
is betweene Moſes and Gods houſe. For, in proportions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of
foure termes, the proportion is alternable. Wherefore, as Moſes is in dignity
inferiour to the houſe; for he is but Gods Miniſter or Legate there, who
though he be ſuperiour to any one perſon there ſingly taken, yet he is
inferiour to the whole taken collectiyely or joyntly. So Chriſt is a
ſecondary unto God, from whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all divine power and
authority, to build and governe Gods houſe in Gods Name. But we muſt take
notice, that in all this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Chriſt with Moſes, there is no
conſideration had of this, that the ancient houſe wherein Moſes was
faithfull to God, was one, and this new houſe is another, wherein God hath
adjoyned Chriſt for the building and governing of it. For, to the purpoſe
in hand, it is enough that both of them are the houſes of God; and the latter
wherein Chriſt governes, is as it were ſucceeded in the roome of that,
wherein Moſes <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61860:24"/>was faithfull; ſo that in this reſpect
they may ſeem in a manner all one. But if any man ſhall urge them to be
diverſe; be ſhall thereby, not only not diminiſh the dignity of Chriſt,
for the advance whereof all theſe things are ſaid, but greatly increaſe
it; for this new houſe in dignity far exceeds the old.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And Moſes verily was faithfull in all his houſe
as a ſervant.</hi>] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he delivered the Prerogative or Dignity of
Chriſt above Moſes, but generally and indefinitly; now he explicates it
more particularly and clearly. Which being done, it will plainly appeare, That
Chriſt is more honourable then Moſes, ſo much as God is more honourable
then his houſe, which is his people; that is, Moſes muſt bee reckoned
with the houſe, and Chriſt with God. The particle <hi>and</hi> here
ſignifies not copulatively, but illatively as much as <hi>for. For Moſes
verily was faithfull as a ſervant.</hi> All the dignity that Moſes had in
Gods houſe was but a ſervile dignity, for he ordered and governed the whole
houſe of God, not as Lord over it, but as a Miniſter and ſervant unto
God. He was the ſteward of Gods houſe; that is, the principall ſervant of
the family, to whoſe charge the Maſter of the family committed the charge
of it; Wherefore hee was alwayes forced to depend upon the becke and pleaſure
of God, as of his Lord, expecting in all things his command. For hence it was
that he could neither move the camp nor pitch it, till firſt he had received
notice of it from God. And this very argument he takes from the teſtimony of
Scripture before cited for the faithfulnes of Moſes; in which verſe God
cals Moſes his ſervant. <hi>For a teſtimony of thoſe things that were
to be ſpoken after.</hi>] Herein is ſpecified the chief office wherein the
ſervice of Moſes conſiſted. God ſpake to his ſervant Moſes mouth
to mouth, and Moſes was to teſtifie and relate unto the people afterward
thoſe things which he had heard ſpoken of God, either concerning their
preſent affairs in the wilderneſſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lawes and
Ordinances to be obſerved for the future in the land of Canaan: for in this
place the word Teſtimony is figuratively taken for a relating or rehearſing
of things that have beene heard ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by another. Hence the Goſpel as it
was firſt ſpoken by God, is called the word of God; but as it was reported
and delivered by Chriſt or the Apoſtles, it is not ſeldome called their
teſtimony. See 1 Cor. 1.6. and 1 Cor. 2.1. and 2 Theſſ. 1.10. and 2 Tim.
1.8. and Rev. 1.2. and Rev. 6.9. and Rev. 12.11. And the two Preachers in the
Revelation are called the witneſſes of God, to whom God will give power to
preach 1260. dayes, Rev. 11.3. For it ſeems, they were therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the
witneſſes of God, becauſe they were to propheſie or preach.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But Chriſt as a Sonne over his owne
houſe.</hi>] Now hee oppoſeth and prefers the dignity of Chriſt before
that of Moſes; becauſe Moſes was but as a ſervant in his Maſters
houſe; but Chriſt as a Sonne in his Fathers houſe: that is, as the Lord
and heire of Gods houſe. And <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61860:25"/>therefore Chriſt muſt
not be reckoned among the goods of the houſe as Moſes was, but muſt be
joyned with the Maſter of the houſe as Lord of the family. And
conſequently Chriſt is ſo much worthier then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as God is worthier
then his own houſe. For theſe words, <hi>Over his owne houſe</hi>] may
bee referred 2 wayes. 1 They may bee referred to Chriſt, as his owne houſe.
And then the compariſon between Chriſt and Moſes will carry an
oppoſition in three things. 1 That Moſes was but the ſervant of God, but
Chriſt was the Son of God. 2 (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the firſt) that Moſes
was only in the houſe as parcell of the houſe; and ſo with the reſt of
the houſe ſubject to the Maſter of the houſe; but Chriſt is over the
houſe as Lord and heire of it. 3 (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to both the former) that
Moſes ordered anothers houſe; but Chriſt governed his owne houſe, that
God had given him by right of inheritance. 2. The words, <hi>Over his owne
houſe</hi>] may bee referred to God, as Gods owne houſe: for the
compariſon ſeems to require, that in each terme thereof mention ſhould be
made of Gods houſe. For the Author either takes it for granted, that this
houſe of God whereof he ſpake, was the houſe of Chriſt, or he takes it
not for granted. If hee take it for granted; to what purpoſe did he ſay,
that Chriſt is over his owne houſe, for if he be Lord and Owner of it, he
muſt needs bee over it? He might have ſaid more briefly, That Moſes was a
ſervant in Gods houſe as in anothers houſe, but Gods houſe was
Chriſts own houſe. But if he take it not for granted, then the reaſon of
this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon and the argument thence drawne, will not appeare. For meerly
from hence, That Chriſt is over his owne houſe, but Moſes was a
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in Gods houſe, it will not follow, that Chriſt is far more
honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then Moſes; for many times it is a greater honour to bee a
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in anothers houſe eſpecially in Gods houſe, then a Maſter
over his owne. Beſides, the argument here is about that houſe wherein both
Chriſt and Moſes were faithfull to God; but faithfulneſſe is ſeen
more in anothers houſe then his owne, or at leaſt not as his owne, but as
anothers. For here is a relation to thoſe words of God formerly cited, That
Moſes was faithfull in all Gods houſe. <hi>Whoſe houſe are we.</hi>]
Hee now expreſſeth what we muſt underſtand by this houſe of God or
Chriſt; namely all they are this houſe that profeſſe the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
Chriſt, of which number theſe Hebrews were a part, and thereby he opens a
paſſage to his following exhortation. The faithfull are the houſe of God,
whether by houſe wee underſtand a family or a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For they are the
family of God and Chriſt, who ſerve God and Chriſt, and are under his
care. They are alſo his building or ſpirituall Temple, becauſe God and
Chriſt doe inhabit them by their holy Spirit; and they are a Tabernacle for
divine worſhip, whereof are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant many teſtimonies of Scripture. Hence
appears the great dignity of Chriſtians, who therefore are to endeavour that
they never fall <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61860:25"/>from it, but that it continue ſtable and
perpetuall. If wee hold faſt the confidence. For confidence, the originall
word properly ſignifies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſpeech, whereby a man ſpeakes
undauntedly, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there bee cauſe of feare. Hence the word is
figuratively drawne to ſignifie courage of minde, and alſo confidence
thence refulting. In this place it may be taken both properly and figuratively;
not only for a confidence or aſſurance of minde, but for a liberty in
profeſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſo that a Chriſtian, what feare ſoever
aſſault him, muſt openly and publickly profeſſe himſelfe the
follower of Chriſt, and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from it by any meanes. And in the
ſame ſenſe it ſeemes the word is taken afterward cap. 10.35. for there
the Author treats not only of inward faith, but of outward profeſſion of
the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Hence it appeares that to make us become the houſe
of God, it is required that we have confidence; and to make us continue ſo,
wee muſt hold our confidence faſt and firme unto the end. And therefore we
are the houſe of God, being of the preſent tenſe, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
as ampliated alſo to the future. For that we ſhould become the houſe of
God for the preſent, it is not required wee ſhould hold faſt our
confidence to the end, but that only for the preſent we ſhould have
confidence. But that we might thence forward continue and remaine the houſe
of God perpetually, we muſt alſo continue and remain in our confidence
perpetually, by holding it faſt to the end. <hi>And the rejoycing of the
hope.</hi>] Hope is put here materially for the thing hoped for, which is
eternal life, for that is the final matter of our hope. Rejoycing is either a
high degree of joy exalted, or an outward expreſſion of our inward joy,
cauſed by our hope of eternal life; for ſuch great hopes muſt needs breed
in us not only joy, but rejoycing. For rejoycing is a patent ſign of hope
latent in us; and it is alſo an effect of that hope: for if our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and hope of eternall life be reall and true in us, it will work this effect in
us to rejoyce of it, by having it alwayes in our mouth, and thereby
profeſſing our ſelves happy and bleſſed. Whence it is no marvell the
Author requires this rejoycing in Chriſtians, ſeeing Paul affirmes of them
alſo, That they rejoyce in hope of the glory of God, Rom. 5.2. And this
rejoycing of our confidence and hope doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily draw with it, and in
a manner compriſeth our rejoycing of Chriſtian Religion, whereon our hope
both depends and relyes. For wee muſt needs perceive that the Authors aime
is, we ſhould hold faſt the Chriſtian Religion, and not only profeſſe
it freely and boldly; but alſo rejoyce in it, becauſe it brings us a ſure
hope of eternall happineſſe. <hi>Firme unto the end.</hi>] Unto the laſt
gaſpe of our life; for this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a firme hope, for then our
confidence is firme and ſtable if it laſt and hold out to the laſt
gaſpe of our life: Unleſſe we ſhall ſay, that a firme hope is
oppoſed to a hope infirme, that is wavering and weake, which comes all to
one; becauſe an infirme or weak hope is not likely <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61860:26"/>to
laſt and hold out to the end. Hence it appeares, that it is poſſible for
a Chriſtian endued to true faith, to fall from that faith: For otherwiſe,
why ſhould the Author annex this condition of perſevering in faith, by
holding it faſt and firme; if they who are once the houſe of God, and have
faith, can no way faile and fall from it? Why in the following admonition doth
he exhort them to conſtancy? Why doth hee will them to take heed of departing
from the living God?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Wherefore as the holy Ghoſt ſaith,</hi>] Here
he begins an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt obſtinacie, that they ſhould not ſhew
themſelves incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and hard hearted againſt the voice of God by
Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. <hi>Wherefore</hi>] this word intimates, that his
Exhortation is drawn from his former diſcourſe. And it may be drawne either
from his laſt words, wherein he ſhewed us to be the houſe of God; and for
our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſo, we muſt perſevere conſtantly in the faith and hope
of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation. For from hence the admonition may well be inferred,
that ſeeing the matter is of ſuch moment, therefore wee ſhould ſhew our
ſelves tractable and obſequious to the voice of God, and ſo perſiſt
conſtantly in the faith. Or it may be drawne from the words before that,
concerning the great dignity of Chriſt above Moſes; for if all obedience
were due to the voice of God delivered by Moſes, how much more reverence and
regard muſt be given to the voice of God publiſhed by Chriſt, who was
much greater then Moſes? <hi>As the holy Ghoſt ſaith.</hi>] <hi>q.
d.</hi> That I may uſe unto you the words of the holy Ghoſt, and ſay unto
you now, as hee ſayth in the Pſalmes. Hee attributes the words of David to
the holy Ghoſt, becauſe David ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them by the inſtinct of the holy
Ghoſt. <hi>To day if yee will heare his voice.</hi>] Theſe words whereof
the Author here makes uſe to apply them to his preſent purpoſe are
extant, Pſal. 95.7. The literall ſence is: Upon the ſolemn feſtivall
day the people were accuſtomed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the temple of God, there to
celebrate Divine worſhip, and to heare the reading of the Law, which was the
word or voice of God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon David compoſed this Pſalme for the
feſtivall day, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the people, that when they went into the
houſe of God to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him and heare his word, they ſhould alſo obey
it, and not harden their hearts againſt it. For the particle <hi>if</hi>] is
put for <hi>when</hi>] when, or ſeeing yee will heare his voice. The
myſticall ſence, The voyce of Chriſt, whereby the Goſpel is revealed
and delivered to men, is the voyce of God. And the time of the Goſpel, is the
feſtivall day of Grace, wherein God offers ſalvation, and invites us to it
by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel; which time will not laſt alwayes in
reſpect of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, but will continue to them but as a day,
during their owne dayes; and to ſome it dureth not during their own dayes.
For ſometimes God is in a manner driven by the contumacy or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of men, either to take from them the preaching of his word, or to 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61860:26"/>harden their ſtubborn hearts that were fore-hardned by
their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, leſt, as himſelf ſaith, Seeing they ſhould ſee,
and hearing they ſhould hear, they ſhould be converted and healed: or
laſtly, hee wholly turnes the day of Grace and Salvation into a day of his
wrath and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, All which things by the juſt judgement of God hapned
at laſt to the nation of the Jewes. Wherefore by theſe words of the
Pſalmiſt they are admoniſhed, that they would ſpeedily ſhew
themſelves tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and aſſoon as they ſhall heare his voice
by Chriſt, they yeeld obedience thereto, without procraſtinating or
delaying the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from day to day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Harden not your hearts.</hi>] Your hearts, that is
your mindes; the member is oftentimes put for the faculty of it. Then a man
hardens his heart, when he reſiſteth the voice of God, and ſuffers not
himſelfe to be perſwaded by it, when he doth the act of oppoſing, and
beſides hath a will to continue it. As hard things ſuffer not themſelves
eaſily to be handled, or moulded, and yeeld not to him that would figure or
faſhion them into another ſhape. This is done, when a man hath a will not
to beleeve or obey the word of God, whether formerly hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved or obeyed
it, or did not. <hi>As in the provocation,</hi>] He notes that notable
contention of the Iſraelites with Moſes at Rephidim for want of water:
which ennobled the place where it was made with the names of Meriba, and
Maſſa. i. Provocation and tentation; whereof ſee Exod. 17. That
Contention is here called Provocation; becauſe in contention there is
commonly provocation; for he that contends with another, doth anger and provoke
him. The Iſraelites, as much as lay in them, did in the firſt place provoke
Moſes, and then by him even God alſo: For this provocation muſt primely
and properly be referred to Moſes and not to God: as contrarily the
temptation muſt prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be referred to God, and not to Moſes. For ſo
Moſes himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it to the people, in ſaying, <hi>Why chide
you with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?</hi> Exod. 17.2. And thereupon the
place was called Chiding and Tempting: But while the Iſraelites chide &amp;
quarrell with Moſes, who did nothing but by Gods command; they are by that
meanes reckoned to have chidden and ſtriven with God. For when a ſecond
time in like manner they murmured at Cades for want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; thoſe waters
alſo are called the waters of Meriba, that is, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or ſtrife,
becauſe the children of Iſrael ſtrove with the Lord. Numb. 20.13. When
notwithſtanding they ſtrove not with the Lord himſelfe, but with Moſes
and Aaron; as appeares in the ſame chapter, verſe 3, 4, 5. So they ſtrive
with Moſes, and therefore with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, while they demand water of
him with diſdaine and anger, ver. 2. while reproachfully and moſt
unworthily they upbraid him, that hee had brought them out of Egypt, to kill
them, their children and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with thirſt in the wilderneſſe, ver. 3.
While therefore the Iſraelites <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61860:27"/>in this manner contend and
chide with Moſes the ſervant of God, did they not bewray the hardneſſe
of their hearts, when by ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works of God, and by ſo many
marveilous benefits beſtowed upon them, they could not be induced to confide
in God, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he would provide them of water. The particle
<hi>as</hi> notes the ſimilitude or likeneſſe of the caſe; and the
ſence is. Doe not you harden your hearts againſt God, to diffide and
diſtruſt him and his voice by Chriſt; as the Iſraelites did in the
Provocation at Meriba, when they did chide and ſtrive with God, in chiding
and ſtriving with Moſes. The like ſpeech we have, Job 29.2. O that I were
as in months paſt! i. that my caſe were like to what it was ſome months
ſince. <hi>In the day of temptation in the wilderneſſe</hi>] Theſe
words are referred both to the Induration and Provocation mentioned before, and
are the two circumſtances of them; for, in the day of Temptation, ſhews the
time of the Provocation, that it was then upon the very ſame day that they
tempted him; they provoked and tempted him both on a day. And in the
wilderneſſe, ſhews the place of it; for it was at Rephidim, a dry plaine
neere Horeb or Mount Sinai, where Moſes fought with Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck. To the end,
that notorious provocation and tentation might be the more remarkable by the
place, and thereby be diſtinguiſhed from others, that fell out in other
places afterward. The matter of the Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein it conſiſted was
this, that they ſaid of God, Is the Lord among us or not? as the text
expreſſeth, Exod 17.7. In which words they doubt of the Divine preſence,
i. they were diffident of God; which diſtruſtfulneſſe of God, and
doubtfulneſſe of his goodneſſe or power, is called a tentation of God.
For, every tentation ariſeth from ſome diſtruſt, or at leaſt from
ſome doubting. He therefore tempteth God, that having many arguments of Gods
goodneſſe toward him, and his power; yet is not ſure of his goodneſſe
or power, but doubts of either, and requires more arguments or tokens thereof.
It is a vulgar errour in men to thinke, that God is then tempted, when a man
truſteth too much upon God; that is, when he caſteth himſelfe into danger
raſhly and unneceſſarily, in confidence of Gods aſſiſtance. This
errour ſeemes to ſpring from the anſwer of Chriſt to Satan, who
required him to caſt himſelfe downe headlong from the pinacle of the
Temple; but Chriſt anſwered, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God; As if
to tempt God, were to caſt himſelfe into danger raſhly, upon too much
truſt of Gods help. But Satan in ſaying to Chriſt, If thou be the Son of
God, caſt thy ſelfe downe, &amp;c. did not intend to draw him to too great
a truſt in God, but rather to diſtruſt and doubt whether he were truly
the Son of God, by ſeeking a further experiment or ſigne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in
caſting himſelfe downe; in as much as it was written of the Son of God,
that Gods Angels had charge over him, to beare him up in their hands, &amp;c.
To whom Chriſt rightly anſwers; It is written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61860:27"/>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God, <hi>q.d.</hi> Seeing it is
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready abundantly evident to me that I am the Son of God, and moſt deare to
God, I will make no further triall thereof, and ſo tempt God, which deed he
hath forbidden. Wherefore this precept of Scripture alledged by Chriſt,
pertaines nothing at all, to any exceſſe of truſt, but muſt be referred
to diſtruſt and doubting, as all other places are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tentation
of God; eſpecially ſeeing in the very text when Chriſt quoteth this
Scripture, of not tempting God, it is added, <hi>as ye tempted him in
Maſſa,</hi> Deut. 6.16. But we have already ſhewed, that the Iſraelites
in Maſſa tempted God, not with exceſſe of truſt, but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of
it. The like words in the like ſence are uſed by Peter, Acts 15 10. Now
therefore, why tempt ye God, to put a yoake upon the neck of the Diſciples?
&amp;c. <hi>q.d.</hi> Hath not God already given us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and arguments
enough, and ſufficient, that we ſhould not impoſe upon the Diſciples
the yoke of legall Ceremonies? ſeeing he hath given the holy Ghoſt to them
as well as to us; ſeeing he hath made no difference betweene us and them,
purifying their hearts by faith; why therefore, as if the thing were not
already apparent enough, do ye require more arguments and tokens of it, and
ſo tempt God?</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>When your fathers tempted me</hi>] Me, here is
referred to God whom the Iſraelites tempted; for here, according to an
uſuall forme in Scripture, the perſon is changed, and God himſelfe is
brought in ſpeaking of himſelfe; whereas in the words before David ſpake
of God in the third perſon, but now brings in God ſpeaking in the firſt
perſon of himſelfe. In the Originall it is not <hi>when</hi> but
<hi>where;</hi> for here the circumſtantiall particle is not temporall for
the time when they tempted, but locall for the place where they tempted; and
that place hath reference to the wilderneſſe immediately before mentioned.
For in the wilderneſſe they tempted God, not onely at that time, but
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo at divers other times, and in other particular places of
that wilderneſſe. For at Cadeſhbarnea, whence the twelve ſpies were
ſent to ſearch the land of Canaan, and upon their returne, the people bad
ſtone Caleb and Joſhuah, becauſe they diſcented from the other ten, who
had brought up an evill report upon the Land; then the Lord complaines that
they had provoked him long and often; that they had long diſtruſted him,
notwithſtanding all the ſignes he had ſhewed amongſt them, Numb. 14.11.
And againe at ver. 22. he complaines that they had tempted him now ten times,
i. very many times. <hi>Proved me</hi>] He expreſſeth the ſame thing in
another word. For, as to tempt a man, argues diſtruſt and doubt of him;
ſo alſo to prove him. <hi>And ſaw my workes:</hi>] The particle
<hi>and</hi> is by an Hebraiſme put for <hi>although; q.d.</hi> If they had
not ſeene my wondrous works, it had beene leſſe wonder that they tempted
me; but now although they ſee them, yet they doubt of my power and
goodneſſe toward them; what a ſtrange <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61860:28"/>diffidence and
diſtruſt is this? What works God wrought, both in Egypt and in the
Wilderneſſe, to certifie the people of his promiſe, and to gaine faith
for their paſſage into Canaan, are largely deſcribed in the books of
Exodus and Numbers. <hi>Forty yeares</hi>] This ſpace of forty yeares, as the
hiſtory it ſelfe, and the Hebrew text, and this Author alſo ſignifies
at ver. 17. muſt be referred forwards to Gods indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he was
grieved with them for the ſpace of forty yeares. Yet it is true alſo, that
this ſpace may be referred backward (as the Septuagint have pointed it) to
the peoples tempting of God, and ſeeing his works for the ſpace of forty
yeares; for ſo long the people tempted him, and ſo long ſaw his works.
For, even at the expiration of thoſe yeares, when Miriam was dead, in
Cadeſh, they againe murmured againſt Moſes and Aaron for want of water,
as their fathers had done before at Meriba and Maſſa, and that place alſo
was branded by the name of Meriba, or waters of ſtrife; where the diffidence
or diſtruſt in God was greater then any formerly, for it was extended even
to Moſes and Aaron, who were alſo infected with the ſin of it. Numb. 20.
And this ſeemes to be cauſe of the Greek pointing and reading, which this
Author followed having fallen upon it, that he might not ſeeme to make any
alteration in it, though afterward at the 17. verſe he plainly ſhews, that
he was not ignorant of the true reading as it was pointed in the Hebrew. But
here is meant that other tentation, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Numb. 14. upon which God ſware
the people ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his reſt, as appeares by the verſes
here following. Hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares their errour who from hence conclude, that the
holy Ghoſt is that God who was tempted of the Jews; therefore becauſe here
God himſelfe ſpeakes, and ſaith he was tempted of their fathers; and the
Author affirmes that the holy Ghoſt ſpake theſe things. Theſe men marke
not, that from the firſt words of this place, and ſo from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of
the whole Pſalme, wherein David himſelfe ſpeakes in very deed in his owne
perſon, and profeſſeth himſelfe one of Gods people, to worſhip and
ſerve God, it will by the ſame reaſon follow, that the holy Ghoſt is
alſo David. For the former words wherein David is brought in ſpeaking, are
no leſſe attributed to the holy Ghoſt. When the ſayings of holy Writers
are attributed to the holy Ghoſt, we are not thereby to underſtand, that
the holy Ghoſt is that perſon who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſpeaks, or to whom thoſe
things really agree, which he attributes to himſelfe that ſpeakes, or is
brought in ſpeaking; but onely that thoſe ſayings were uttered by the
vertue and motion of the holy Ghoſt, and not onely by the will and pleaſure
of men, whoſoever the perſon be that ſpeaketh, as Peter teacheth, 2 Pet.
1.21. For otherwiſe there muſt be one onely perſon alwaies brought in
ſpeaking, namely, the holy Ghoſt, to whom alone all ſayings muſt be
attributed, which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to himſelfe that ſpeaketh; then which
nothing can be further <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61860:28"/>from the truth. For the Prophets for
the moſt part uſe to ſpeake in their owne perſons, ſometime they
bring in God ſpeaking, whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Holy Ghoſt is, ſometime they
bring in other perſons. Beſides from this, that the words of God are
attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, we cannot rightly conclude that therefore the
Holy Ghoſt is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Are they not rightly attributed to him
therefore, becauſe God ſpeaks by him? as we read that the words of Chriſt
are attributed to the Spirit, Rev. 2.7. although the Spirit be not Chriſt. So
Paul, Rom. 11.4. attributes the words of God to the oracle; and this Author,
cap. 12.5. attributes the words of God to the Exhortation; not that either the
oracle or the exhortation is God, but becauſe God is ſuppoſed to ſpeake
by the oracle and the exhortation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Wherefore I was grieved with that
generation</hi>] That is, a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration according to Scripture which
comprehends the men that live within the period of one and the ſame age. And
that generation wherewith God was grieved, were thoſe perſons of Iſrael,
whom hee brought out of Egypt, who ſaw his mighty workes, and received the
Law at Mount Sinai. This generation provoked and tempted God, and therefore God
was grieved with it. God is not paſſively grieved as man, but then he is
ſaid to be grieved, when he doth ſuch actions as perſons grieved uſe to
doe; eſpecially being thereto provoked by the ſinnes of men. <hi>And ſaid
they doe alwayes erre in their hearts.</hi>] They have a kinde of phrenſie or
madneſſe upon them, that is not accidentall to fall on them ſometimes,
but naturall and radicall, rooted and fixed in their very hearts, ſo that it
continues upon them to hold them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. They alwayes meditate and agitate in
their minde, that which is averſe from my will, and from the way whereto I
labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them. They alwayes refuſe to obey me, and follow the
erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of their owne minds, and are wedded to the counſells of
their owne wils. <hi>And they have not knowne my wayes.</hi>] By the wayes of
God we may underſtand both the workes of God, and the Lawes of God,
eſpecially his ſingular commands for ſuch or ſuch an action in
particular. For the acts and works of men are in Scripture called their wayes.
That generation is juſtly ſaid to have knowne neither of theſe wayes of
God; for though they had ſeen his works and heard his laws, and received many
particular commands; yet they carryed themſelves ſo, as if they had neither
ſeen, heard, nor received any thing. For they neither believed Gods
promiſes, though confirmed with ſuch mighty works, nor obeyed his Laws and
Commands. Of this their groſſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity there is a notable paſſage,
Deut. 29.2,3,4. Ye have ſeen (ſaith Moſes to them) all that the Lord did
before your eyes in the land of Egypt, unto Pharaoh, unto his ſervants, and
unto all his land; The great temptations which thine eyes have ſeene; the
ſignes and thoſe great miracles: yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to
perceive, <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61860:29"/>and eyes to ſee, and ears to heare unto this
day. They ſaw Gods mighty workes like brute beaſts, not conſidering how
great the Agent was, and of how great power; how worthy he was to have all
credit given to his promiſes, and all obedience to his commands. Some ſuch
like accident befell the Diſciples of Chriſt as we may read it, Mark. 6.52.
They conſidered not the miracle of the loaves, for their heart was
hardned.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Sol ſware in my wrath.</hi>] God ſeldome
ſweares, for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not bring him in ſwearing often: but it
muſt be a matter of weight and moment that makes him to ſweare: And motives
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſweares are chiefly two; either in mercy, to confirme his
gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes made to his children: or in his wrath to eſtabliſh his
judgement againſt the wicked. And the formes whereby he ſweares are chiefly
two. 1 Surely, (for ſurely with God is a forme of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) that is, the
thing which he affirmes and whereto hee ſweares is no way uncertaine or
doubtfull for the event, as if it might not come to paſſe, but ſhall
moſt ſurely and certainly come to paſſe. In this form God ſware to
Abraham, that he would bleſſe and multiply him; for ſo this Author
reports it, cap. 6.14. 2. <hi>As I live;</hi> that is, let me not bee accounted
for the living God, if I performe not what I ſay. In this forme God
ſweares, that he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Ezek. 33.11.
And as among men there be degrees of oaths, in that ſome are more obligatory
and binding, leſt the Iſraelites might thinke that God would not fully
binde himſelfe, for their not entring into Canaan; therefore to divert that
flattery of themſelves, God did ſwear it by both theſe forms of oaths.
For firſt he ſware it by the firſt form. Surely they ſhall not ſee
the land which I ſware unto their fathers. Num. 14.23. And afterward he
ſware it by the ſecond form. As I live, your carkaſſes ſhall fall in
this wilderneſſe. Numb. 14.28. Thus God ſwearing in his wrath, did
iterate his oath &amp; aggravate it. <hi>They ſhall not enter.</hi>] In the
originall it is, <hi>if</hi> they ſhall enter. The particle <hi>if,</hi>
after a verbe of ſwearing is an Hebraiſme put for <hi>not:</hi> they
ſhall not enter. So the people ſweare for the reſcue of Jonathan, As the
Lord liveth, if one haire of his head ſhould fall to the ground, 1 Sam.
14.45. So the Pſalmiſt brings in God ſwearing, Once have I ſworn by my
holineſſe, if I lie unto David, Pſal. 89.35. So Chriſt ſweares, that
a ſigre ſhall not be given to the Jewes: Verily I ſay unto you, if a
ſigne ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this generation, Mark. 8.12. yet this uſe of the
particle <hi>if</hi> did firſt ariſe from thoſe formes of ſwearing,
whereby <hi>if</hi> was properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by adding ſome imprecation or
curſe, either expreſſely uttered, or tacitly implyed. For men being moved
doe commonly in their anger uſe an abrupt ſpeech, and many times ſilently
ſuppreſſe the imprecation or curſe whereby they devote themſelves,
and leave it to be collected by him to whom they ſpeake. Among many others we
have David <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61860:29"/>ſwearing with an imprecation or curſe
expreſſely added: So and more alſo, doe God to the enemies of David, if I
leave of all that pertain to Naball by the morning light, any that piſſeth
againſt the wall, 1 Sam. 25.22. And Job in like manner, if my heart have been
deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbours doore; Then let my
wife grinde unto another, and let others bow downe upon her, Job 31.9. And ye
have this curſe ſuppreſſed in David alſo, Pſal. 132.2,3,4,5. They
that ſhall not enter, are that generation that had provoked, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and
grieved God. God had ſworne to the Patriarks (the forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that
generation) that their poſterity ſhould enter that land, this God had
ſworne at ſeverall times to Abraham, he had confirmed the ſame oath to
Iſaac, and reconfirmed it to Jacob. And God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or deſigned
which generation of his poſterity ſhould enter; namely the fourth, for ſo
particularly God covenanted with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 15.16. And this people now
brought out of Egypt into the wilderneſſe for to enter, was that fourth
generation: yet to them now God ſweares againe that they ſhall not enter.
Yet notwithſtanding there is no contrariety in Gods oaths, neither doth this
latter ſwearing any way croſſe the former. For the promiſe of God to
Abraham and ſo the oath confirming it, for this entrance of his poſterity,
was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall that his children ſhould walke in the ſteps of the faith
and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Abraham; for the Covenant of God was made with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and
his ſeed; and therefore not only he in his owne perſon, but his poſterity
alſo in their generations were bound to keep it. But this generation whereof
we ſpeake, was diffident and diſobedient, for they provoked and tempted
God, and thereby brake the Covenant: And the Covenant being broken on their
part, or the condition not performed, God in all equity on his part is free
both from his promiſe and the oath confirming it; and therefore as the caſe
now ſtood might juſtly take an oath for their not entring. Now that faith
and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was required as a condition for their entring, appears cleerly
by the laſt verſe of this Chapter, where it is ſaid, they could not enter
becauſe of unbeliefe. For if the cauſe of their not-entring were
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving; then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that Beliefe was the
condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their entring. But as this oath proceeded from the wrath of God,
touching the non-entry of this generation: ſo it was tempered and mingled
with mercy for the next generation who were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this. For
concerning thoſe children this generation had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, in ſaying they
ſhould be a prey and dye in the wilderneſſe. But God makes it a part of
his oath, to the contrary, that their children ſhould not bee a prey in the
wilderneſſe, but they ſhall enter the land and poſſeſſe it, Numb.
14.30,31. <hi>Into my reſt.</hi>] The land of Canaan is called a Reſt;
becauſe the Iſraelites were to reſide and reſt, after their hard
ſervitude for many yeares in Egypt, after their tedious pilgrimage 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61860:30"/>and travell through the vaſt wilderneſſe where they
wandred for the ſpace of forty yeares; and after their ſeverall battells
with their enemies which they were to conquer and extirpate from that land.
Although there be another myſticall uſe of the word in the Chapter
following. And God calls it <hi>his</hi> Reſt; becauſe the people got it
neither by their power not by their deſert, but by Gods meere benefit and
donation to them, in performance of the promiſe he had ſworn to their
forefathers, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob. For God by his mighty arme and power,
brought them out of Egypt, carried them through the wilderneſſe, and caſt
out their enemies before them, that they might poſſeſſe the land; not
for any righteouſneſſe in them, but for the wickedneſſe of the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites, thereby to performe his word ſworne to their fathers, Deut. 9
4.5.6.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Take heed brethren.</hi>] Here he begins another
Exhortation, to diſſ wade them from Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian
Religion, from the which they were declining, and departing. For the
deſertion of God muſt needs be a greater ſinne then the tentation of him.
Take heed. <hi>i.</hi> Bethinke your ſelves well, and have a great care,
becauſe the matter is very dangerous; for when dangers are at hand, we uſe
to be heedfull and carefull. <hi>Leſt there be.</hi>] Leſt there be now at
this time, or if it be not yet, leſt it creep upon you in time to come; for
Apoſtacie is as a ſerpent that will inſinuate into your mindes at any
time; for it is eaſily introduced by diffidence and obſtinacie. <hi>In any
of you.</hi>] Hee meanes not this diſtributively for any one ſingle
perſon among them; but collectively of them all, that all might have a care
of all, and each one of another. <hi>An evill heart of unbeliefe</hi>] An evill
heart is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable or hard heart, that is contumacious and refractory
againſt God and his word. And then the heart is eſpecially evill and hard,
when it is incredulous and unbeleeving; <hi>q.d.</hi> a heart ſo evill that
it will not believe. <hi>In departing from the living God</hi>] Here he limits
the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe whereof he ſpake before, deſigning particularly what
unbelief he meant. For there is a double unbeliefe, one of them who never yet
did believe in God; another of them who ceaſe to believe, and turne
Apoſtates to their former beliefe in departing from it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
from God. Now he departs from God, who departs from Chriſt, and his Religion;
as in the former Covenant, he that departed from the Law, departed from God
himſelfe. For as he that believes in Chriſt, doth not finally believe in
Chriſt, but in God by Chriſt; as Chriſt himſelfe declareth it, John
12.44. So on the contrary, he that departeth from Chriſt, departs not only
finally from Chriſt, but from God who ſent him, and ordained him to bee our
Lord and Saviour. And God is called the <hi>living God,</hi> in oppoſition to
the Idols and falſe gods of the Gentiles, who were as deſtitute of all life
and ſenſe, as were their images and ſtatues wherein they were
worſhipped. This <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61860:30"/>Epithet is added here to God, thereby to
ſtrike ſo much the greater terrour into them, that they might never think
of departing from ſo great a God; Therefore he ſaith afterward, chapter 10.
ver. 31. It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God. For
hee muſt needs have an infinite power, who is the true and living God. Yet
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively God is called the living God, becauſe he not onely lives truely
and perpetually, but alſo lives from himſelfe, and is the fountain of life
to others, from whom all living things have their life.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>But exhort one another daily,</hi>] Here he
ſhewes the ordinary way and meanes, whereby they may remedy this evill heart
of unbeliefe; namely, if they mutually admoniſh and exhort one another; yet
that muſt not be done ſeldome at diſtant times: but <hi>daily,</hi> that
their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exhortations may be fervent and frequent. <hi>While it is called
to day.</hi>] As long as that day laſteth, whereof mention is made in the
Pſalme before cited, To day if ye will hear his voyce. Whereupon we noted
above, that in the literall ſence; it ſignified, that feſtivall and
ſolemne day, wherein the people reſorted to the Temple, to performe the
worſhip and ſervice of God, where alſo the Law of God uſed to be read
unto them. To this feſtivall day in the myſticall ſence, doth anſwer
our Chriſtian feſtivall or time of Grace, wherein we are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lay
hold of eternall ſalvation, whereto by the Goſpel the paſſage is opened
unto us. While this day or time of the Goſpel doth laſt, we muſt exhort
one another from unbeliefe in departing from God. <hi>Leſt any of you be
hardned,</hi>] A man is then hardned, when hee hath a will, not to beleeve the
promiſes of God, or not to obey his precepts. <hi>Through the
deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</hi>] He ſhewes the cauſe of this
hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be ſinne; and the manner how ſinne hardneth, by
deceaving us. For therefore we are refractory to the voyce or word of God,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are deceived byſinne; for we are entrapped by the baits and
ſnares of ſin, by preferring the whiſpers of ſin before the voyce of
God; for ſo the Serpent beguiled Eve, and ſo doth ſin deceive us ſtill.
Yea, even from the word of God, and from his Commandment: whence wee ſhould
take occaſion to obey him, thence will ſinne take occaſion to deceive us.
Rom. 7.11.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>For we are made partakers of Chriſt.</hi>] Hee
ſeemes here to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere a tacite objection. For theſe Hebrewes might
thinke that theſe admonitions concerned not them, that they need to take heed
of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and conſequently of Gods wrath, ſeeing they did already
beleeve in Chriſt, and ſo were eſtated in Chriſtian happineſſe. To
this hee anſweres, by granting that they were already made partakers of
Chriſt; that is, of that happineſſe which Chriſt beſtowes upon the
faith full, yet upon that condition, that they perſevere in the faith of
Chriſt to their lives end. For this partaking of Chriſt or Chriſtian
happineſſe, as it referres to this life, conſiſteth in a full right or
title to happineſſe: but <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61860:31"/>this right or title is
preſently loſt, when we recede or depart from the faith of Chriſt. <hi>If
we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end.</hi>]
Theſe words are correſpondent and reſpective to the ſixth verſe of
this chapter. For to be the houſes of God and Chriſt, what is it elſe,
then to be partaker of Chriſt? This at leaſt every man may eaſily
perceive, that theſe two are ſo connexed, that they cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
one from another. And in like manner, to hold the beginning of our confidence
ſtedfaſt unto the end, is the ſame (if we reſpect the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors minde)
with, To hold faſt the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firme unto
the end. The originall for confidence, is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which properly ſignifies
ſubſiſtence; and our ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence ſtands in this,
that we beleeve in Chriſt and obey his precepts. For as long as wee continue
in the ſtate of faith and obedience unto Chriſt; ſo long we have our
ſpirituall ſubſiſtence. Yet it is well tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confidence,
figuratively from the effect of it; becauſe confidence is a ſubſiſtence
of things not ſubſiſting: for it doth as it were repreſent unto our
view, or ſet before our eyes, a thing not yet ſeen, or not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting,
by making us as certaine of it, as if we ſaw it before our eyes, or did
already really enjoy it. Hence afterward the Author notifies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or
faith to be the ſubſtance or ſubſiſtence of things hoped for. Heb.
11.1.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>While it is ſayd to day,</hi>] By theſe words
cited out of the Pſalm, hee would ſhew, that the matter is ſo, as he
ſaid in the former verſes; namely, that they who perſiſt in the faith
to the end, they only are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt and his happineſſe: but
they who depart from the faith, ſhall undoubtedly periſh, what ever were
their happineſſe and condition heretofore: <hi>Harden not your
hearts,</hi>] againſt the voice of God, who now ſpeaks to us by Chriſt.
<hi>As in the provocation.</hi>] Hence it plainly appeares to every man, who
they are that hearing the voyce of God, harden their hearts againſt it, and
provoke; namely they that unbeleeve the Goſpel, and depart from the Covenant
of it. For as the Author addeth in the next verſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>For ſome when they had heard did provoke.</hi>]
Let us now ſee who hearing the voyce of God, did provoke him, and who did
not; and let us compare them one with another: For then wee ſhall eaſily
diſcover, That they hardned their hearts againſt the voice of God, and
provoked him, who would not finally beleeve him to the end: and that they did
not provoke him, who were conſtant in their faith, as were Caleb and
Joſhua. <hi>Who came out of Egypt by Moſes</hi>] Hee ſhewes that both
theſe kinds who provoked, and who provoked not, came out of Egypt by Moſes.
i. Who followd Moſes, and by his leading forſooke Egypt, and for ſome
time adhered to him: Wherby it appeares, that they who have followed Chriſt
their captaine, and for ſome time have adhered to him, doe harden their
hearts againſt the voyce of God and provoke <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61860:31"/>him if they
forſake Chriſt their Captaine, and will returne back to the ſpirituall
Egypt of the world. But contrarily, they who having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, doe adhere
to him unto the end, as Joſhua and Caleb did, who never forſooke Moſes,
they ſhall enjoy that happineſſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſt.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>But with whom was he grieved fourty yeeres.</hi>]
Now the Authour from the remaining words of the Pſalme doth prove the very
ſame thing; namely, That they who have followed Chriſt their Captaine,
muſt take heed of offending and ſinning againſt God; or as he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it before, of being hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin, for
thereby God will be ſo grieved and provoked againſt them, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they muſt needs periſh. <hi>Was it not with them that had ſinned,</hi>]
i. God was grieved and provoked onely with them that unbeleeved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and
tempted him. <hi>Whoſe carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſſe</hi>] All
that came out of Egypt, excepting onely Joſhua and Caleb, died in the
wilderneſſe, and heir carcaſſes were not carried into the land of
Canaan. From which words of the Pſalme he in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that God
will be grieved and provoked with Chriſtians, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt him and
tranſgreſſing his precepts. For, that he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with thoſe
offendors for the ſpace of forty yeares, it hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, in that their
carcaſſes fell in the Deſert, i. every one of them to a man from twenty
yeares old and upward periſhed in the Deſert, and entred not into the
promiſed land. For this wrath of God continued upon them forty yeares, till
they were all conſumed either by naturall death, or by divers plagues. See
Numb. 14.29,33,34.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>And to whom ſware he that they ſhould not
enter into his reſt, but to them that beleeved not.</hi>] As the former words
ſhew, that thoſe Chriſtians ſhall periſh, who are indulgent to
ſinne, and will not obey Gods precepts: So theſe in like manner make it
evident, that they alſo ſhall periſh, and never enjoy that heavenly and
eternall reſt, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to diffidence, and will not beleeve Gods
promiſes, or after they have beleeved, recede from their faith. For what
induced God to bind himſelfe with an oath, that the Iſraelites ſhould not
enter into his reſt, but their unbeliefe, in deſpairing they ſhould never
attaine the Land that had beene promiſed them? See Numb. 14. from the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>So we ſee, that they could not enter in,
becauſe of unbeliefe.</hi>] From the former paſſages he inferres this
concluſion, That the Iſraelites though they came forth out of Egypt, yet
they could not enter into the promiſed Land, by reaſon of their unbeliefe.
From whence in like manner we muſt conclude, That Chriſtians alſo having
followed Chriſt their Captaine, ſhall not enter that heavenly reſt,
unleſſe by the example of Joſhua and Caleb, they finally remaine
faithfull to their Captaine, and fall not into unbeliefe. From hence it
appeares, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61860:32"/>that the Author would in a manner ſay, what
juſt cauſe he had to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them, that they ſhould take diligent
heed, leſt in any of them, though now they did beleeve, or ſeemed to
themſelves to beleeve, there ſhould be found an evill and unbeleeving
heart, that was thinking to depart from the living God. Which exhortation of
his, thus drawne and demonſtrated from the former paſſages, he more fully
repeats and preſſeth in the entrance to the next Chapter.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et us therefore feare</hi>] Becauſe we have
already ſeene, that our Anceſtors by reaſon of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe were not
admitted into the reſt of God; and that their example is propoſed unto us,
as a caution to make us the more wary; therefore let us feare, that we runne
not upon the ſame rock. <hi>Leſt a promiſe being left us</hi>] So our
laſt Tranſlation reads it; as if God had alſo left a promiſe unto us;
hereto induced as it ſeemes, by the following words of the Author, where he
inferres and concludes, That there remaineth a reſt to the people of God,
ver. 9. But we cannot approve of this <pb n="59" facs="tcp:61860:32"/>reading, neither doth
the Author uſe altogether the ſame word in both places; wherefore we
conceive this the true reading, <hi>Leſt the promiſe being
relinquiſhed</hi>] i. leſt we neglect, relinquiſh, leave, or forſake
the promiſe. For, a promiſe is then relinquiſhed and left, when it is no
longer credited and beleeved, as our forefathers did, whoſe example (as we
have ſeene) was formerly propoſed unto us. They for a time did embrace and
accept of Gods promiſe, for upon that ground and hope they went out of Egypt,
but afterward in the wilderneſſe they did relinquiſh and leave the
promiſe, by their unbelieving it. <hi>Of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his reſt</hi>] He
expreſſeth the matter of the promiſe which we muſt not leave; God hath
promiſed us an entrance into his eternall reſt, we muſt not deſert and
leave it, by unbelieving it. <hi>Any of you ſhould ſeeme to come ſhort of
it</hi>] This is the effect and fruit of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting or leaving the
promiſe, that thereby we ſhall come ſhort of the reſt promiſed. To
come ſhort, ſignifies either to remaine behinde, or to returne back; for in
this latter ſence, the word is uſed afterward, chap. 12.25. Both theſe
ſences have an elegant agreement with the point. For as the Iſraelites,
after they no longer beleeved Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for the giving of them
poſſeſſion in the land of Canaan, would goe no further forward in
following of Moſes, but would rather chuſe themſelves new Captaines for
their returne back into Egypt. So they who will no longer give faith to the
promiſes of Chriſt, will follow his ſtanderd no further, but endeavour a
returne into the Egypt of the world, from whence by faith they had once
departed. Yet he ſaith not ſimply, leſt any of you come ſhort, but
leſt any ſhould <hi>ſeeme to come ſhort;</hi> This latter of ſeeming
is farre leſſe then the other. For we muſt be ſo farre from this
ſinne of ſtopping or returning from the Goſpel, that we muſt give no
man any juſt occaſion to thinke it of us. For ſuch an opinion of another,
carries ſomewhat of truth with it; and if a man do not yet plainly revolt,
yet at leaſt ſome inclination or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods of it, are wont to be in him.
And this opinion a man may raiſe in others of himſelfe, if by little and
little he remit and abate of his practiſe and fervency in godlineſſe, not
ſerving Chriſt with ſuch alacrity as is fit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For unto us it was preached as well as to
them</hi>] It was preached, i. the promiſe of entring into Gods reſt, the
meſſage of which promiſe was ſent unto us alſo. Herein the Author
meets with an objection. For ſome man might ſay, The promiſe of entring
into Gods reſt, was it not made to our forefathers of old, and long ſince
performed unto them, in giving them poſſeſſion in the land of Canaan?
What doth this promiſe pertaine to us? The Author anſwers; That this
promiſe doth pertaine to us, and the joyfull meſſage of entring into Gods
reſt, was no leſſe ſent to us, then of old to our forefathers. But what
kinde of reſt is promiſed to us, he expreſſeth afterward. <hi>But the
word preached <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61860:33"/>did not profit them.</hi>] In the originall,
it is the word of hearing by an Hebraiſme, for the word heard. And by the
words is figuratively ment the promiſe of entring into Gods reſt: for every
promiſe of God is his word. Here he tacitly ſhews the cauſe, why he
admoniſhed them to believe the promiſe of God by Chriſt, becauſe
otherwiſe it would profit us no more, then anciently it did the Iſraelites,
whom it ſo farre profited as to bring them out of Egypt; but it profited them
not to bring them into Canaan, which was the land promiſed. <hi>Not being
mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi>] The reaſon why the hearing of
the word of promiſe did not profit them, was becauſe it was not mixed with
faith in them; it was not throughly engrafted into their m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es, nor turned into a ſap or blood to doe them good.
For this worke is done by faith, by a firme aſſent yeelded to the word and
promiſe of God, to aſſure the promiſe, that the thing promiſed might
take effect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For we which have believed doe enter
interreſt.</hi>] Hee addes a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſon of his former aſſertion.
Becauſe they only among us who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, enter into reſt; and therefore
they who beleeve not, do not enter into reſt; neither can enter. For the
particle only or ſome other ſuch excluſive muſt be here underſtood;
becauſe faith is the condition of entring Gods reſt, which reſtraines the
entrance only to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. As he ſaid, <hi>As I have ſworne in my
wrath, if they ſhall enter into my
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt</hi>] By this oath of God,
Pſal. 95. ult. as we noted in the former Chapter, it plainly appeares, that
they which beleeve not ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Gods reſt; for want of ſaith
is the cauſe, why men are ſtrucken with the thunder of Gods wrath, and
debarred from the promiſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into his reſt. As the promiſe of
entrance proceeds from Gods mercy, and is confirmed by his oath to the
beleever: ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the menance of non-entrance proceeds from Gods
wrath, and is conſi med by his oath to the unbeleever. <hi>Although the works
were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the foundation of the world.</hi>] Here the Author
teacheth, what kinde of reſt it is, that from thoſe words of the Pſalme
muſt bee underſtood in a myſticall ſence. And this hee doth therefore,
that thereby wee may underſtand the truth of thoſe things which he had
aſſerted in the firſt and ſecond verſes of this Chapter, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a reſt of God promiſed to us, and a paſſage thereto made open to us.
Which the Hebrews could neither underſtand, nor would admit to be true, while
their minds ran upon an earthly reſt in Canaan, firſt promiſed and
afterward performed to their forefathers; unleſſe it bee explicated what
the reſt is that is promiſed to us, and ſo their mindes be drawne from an
earthly to an heavenly reſt. Firſt, therefore the Author expreſſeth
ſomewhat of that reſt, and ſaith it is a Reſt from workes; from workes
that were finiſhed, and finiſhed long ſince, even from the foundation of
the world. Which Reſt is proper to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61860:33"/>as it
is intimated in the words of the Pſalme, wherein God calls this reſt, his
reſt. For the Reſt proper to God himſelfe, wherewith he himſelfe
reſted, is by a far better title called the Reſt of God, then that whereof
God was only the donor, ſuch as was the Reſt of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites in the
land of Canaan. Not that this reſt proper to God is nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically the very
ſame, with that future reſt which God hath promiſed us; but becauſe
generically it is a Reſt of the ſame kinde. For as Gods Reſt was a
perpetuall Reſt in reſting from his workes for ever: ſo ſhall our
Reſt bee perpetuall in reſting for ever from all our labours and troubles,
wherein we ſhall have an eternall feſtivall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For he ſpake in a certaine place of the ſeventh
day.</hi>] Here hee ſhews the reaſon why he underſtands that reſt of
God, to be his Reſt from his workes which hee had finiſhed from the
beginning of the world; namely becauſe the Scripture or the Holy Ghoſt
ſpeaking in the Scripture, ſpeaketh in that manner of the ſeventh day as
Gen. 2 2. and Exod 20.11. <hi>And God did reſt the ſeventh day from all his
works.</hi>] In theſe words wee have ſhewed us the Reſt of God, neither
in the whole Scripture to which only we muſt look here, is mentioned or
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any other reſt of God, whereof the people ſhould come to bee
partakers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And in this place againe, If they ſhall enter
into my reſt.</hi>] <hi>q d.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing here againe in theſe
words of the Pſalme, there is mention made of Gods reſt, whereof Gods
people ſhall partake, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with good reaſon in a genuine and
myſticall ſenſe doe we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, of that only reſt of God
ſpecified in the Scripture. But that this reſt alſo belongs unto the
people, the very feſtivall and reſt of the Sabbath commanded to Gods
people, is a clear argument, wherein there is not only a commemoration of Gods
reſt paſt; but alſo a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Reſt of Gods people to
come. Whereof we ſhall ſpeake further at the ninth verſe following.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Seeing therefore it remaineth that ſome muſt
enter therein.</hi>] After he had ſhewed, that by the words of the Pſalme
in a myſticall ſenſe, we muſt underſtand the proper reſt of God, or
that wherein God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reſted; now he proceeds on, to ſhew that that
reſt of God menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the words of the Pſalme, doth appertaine unto us,
and that a paſſage therto is opened unto us. And firſt, he layes certain
grounds for this doctrine, and then removes the obſtacles that may ſeem
againſt it. The firſt ground is, That ſome muſt enter into the reſt.
2. That they to whom it was firſt propoſed and promiſed, entered not into
it. For from theſe two grounds it will follow, That ſome other after that
time muſt enter it. But becauſe it might be objected, That though thoſe
Iſraelites who came our of Egypt, entered not that reſt, yet their children
entred it by the conduct of Joſuah their Captaine. And therefore it cannot
bee concluded, that Chriſtians are they that <pb n="62" facs="tcp:61860:34"/>ſhall
enter it. This Objection or rather Exception hee diſſolves by ſhewing,
that in thoſe words of the Pſalme whereof he yet treats, for ſome
ſeverall ages after the Iſraelites were poſſeſſed of the land of
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, there is another time appointed, wherein an entrance into Gods Reſt
was to be opened; whence it followes that by the conduct of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah, Gods
people have not yet attained the true reſt. Whereupon the Author at length
concludes, That as yet there remaines a Sabbatiſme or reſt for the people
of God. This being done, he repeats the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation begun at the beginning of
this Chapter, and ſo returnes to the point from whence he had digreſſed.
This is the ſumme of all that is ſaid unto the end of the 11 verſe. Now
let us conſider the ſeverall words in order. <hi>That ſome muſt enter
therein.</hi>] Seeing it is the will and good pleaſure of God that a
paſſage ſhould be open to that reſt, and that ſome ſhould enter
into it; for this the Author ſuppoſeth as a thing well knowne and no way
doubtfull. For that thoſe firſt people that fell in the wilderneſſe
were by their owne fault excluded from it, this nothing derogates from Gods
promiſe, whereby he aſſured this reſt by oath upon the poſterity of
Abraham, to be fulfilled in other perſons better and more worthy then thoſe
firſt that failed of it. But under the cover of carnall promiſes and an
earthly reſt, there lay hidden ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall promiſes of an heavenly reſt
pertaining to the ſpirituall ſeed of Abraham. And the entrance of the
Iſraelites into that earthly reſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the conduct of Joſuah,
what is it elſe but a type and ſhadow of Chriſtians future entrance into
a heavenly reſt by the conduct of Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>And they to whom it
was firſt preached entred not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of unbeliefe.</hi>] Firſt
preached in the originall; they that had the firſt good meſſage for the
entring of it. This is the other point that he confirmes, and by occaſion
whereof the Holy Ghoſt leaves us the following admonition, To day if ye will
heare his voice, harden not your hearts. For becauſe thoſe firſt of our
fathers to whom God had ſent the meſſage by Moſes for the entring of
that reſt, deſerved by their diffidence and diſobedience to be excluded
from it; therefore the Holy Ghoſt hath in theſe words appointed to their
poſterity another day or time wherein they may and muſt ente into Gods
reſt; and withall exhorts them to it, leſt following the like
diſobedience to their forefathers, they incur a like iſſue of their
impiety.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Againe he limiteth a certaine day,</hi>] This is
very good cauſe, why another day ſhould be limited for enterance into Gods
reſt, if ſome muſt enter it at all; and they who were firſt invited,
entered it not. For if either none were to enter it, or ſome had already
entered it, then there were no neceſſity why another day or time ſhould
be limited or appointed for entering it. But in theſe words of the Pſalm,
that the holy Ghoſt in a myſticall ſence ſhewes, there is ſuch a day
limited, which pertains to the times of the Meſſias, theſe following
arguments declare. <pb n="63" facs="tcp:61860:34"/> 1. Becauſe by theſe words the
people are admoniſhed, to ſhunne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their forefathers, that
came out of Egypt, that they may not be like them in their ſin. But their
forefathers ſin was chiefly this, that they would not reſt in Gods
promiſes for their enterance into his reſt. Therefore if wee muſt truly
be either like or unlike to them, wee alſo muſt have Gods promiſe for our
entrance into Gods reſt, and therefore this day here is limited unto us for
our entrance into it. 2. Becauſe in this Pſalme is propoſed to the
people, the judgement or puniſhment of God whereinto their fathers fell, that
they being terrified thereby, and fearing the like, would not imitake their
fathers: But that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a rejection from entrance into Gods reſt;
which penaltie no man can incurre but he, that hath had firſt a power to
enter it, and was thereto invited. Seeing therefore that in theſe words of
the holy Ghoſt, the people are admoniſhed to avoid that puniſhment, it is
conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon, that a day or time of entrance ſhould be limited to
them, that we at this day might do what anciently our fathers would not. But
that this Pſalme pertaineth alſo to the times of the Meſſias, this is
an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, That it clearly appears, there is a reſpect therein to ſome
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſeltivall time, wherein the people were accuſtomed to
aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the temple of God, and employ themſelves about his
worſhip; for this is plaine from the words of the people cohorting one
another to praiſe God, and from the word <hi>to day,</hi> which the holy
Ghoſt uſeth. All which ſeeme not to note out ſome common day, but
ſome notable day, deputed for the worſhip and ſervice of God,
eſpecially for the hearing of his word or voice, ſuch as were the
feſtivall and ſolemne dayes. But what day is more ſolemne, what time more
feſtivall, what greater celebrity and concourſe of people, then that which
in the times of the Meſſias was to be, and was of all expected? From
theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations therefore it may well be collected, That by thoſe
words of the holy Ghoſt, in a myſticall ſence, the people are warned to
open a ready eare to the voyce of God, who in his due time will call and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them to his true and heavenly reſt by the Meſſias; which their
forefathers would not doe, when they heard Gods voyce promiſing them the
earthly reſt by Moſes. In the literall ſence, this Pſalme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to
the Iſraelites, who lived before the times of Chriſt, wherein they were
admoniſhed, that upon the day when they were to heare the Law of God, they
ſhould be obedient unto him, leſt following the diſobedience of their
forefathers, they ſhould be debarred from Gods reſt, or otherwiſe
puniſhed and plagued of God. But who ſees not, that this ſence, wherein
the ſinne and puniſhment are made of one kinde? doth better ſquare with
it, then that wherein both of them are made of a diverſe kinde? Aſter the
Author had ſhewed, that God had limited another day for entrance into his
reſt, leſt any man ſhould take this day, to be that day wherein God
granted the children of thoſe <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61860:35"/>fathers a power to enter
into the land of Canaan by the conduct of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, therefore the Author
inſerts theſe words, <hi>Saying in David, To day after ſo long a
time.</hi> He ſaith the holy Ghoſt limiteth this day in David. i.
ſpeaking it by David; After ſo long a time, namely, wherein God had
debarred thoſe fathers from enterance, by reaſon of their unbelief, and
admitted their children to it. <hi>To day if ye will heare his voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
not your hearts,</hi>] Whence it appeares, that here is not appointed a day for
enterance into the land of Canaan, neither is thae enterance here aymed at. For
David lived many ages after the enterance of the Iſraelites into the land of
Canaan; yea, in the time of his reigne the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites did moſt entirely
poſſeſſe it, and flouriſh in it. Seeing therefore the day of entering
into Gods reſt, cannot be underſtood of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt, which the
people obtained by Joſhua; therefore there muſt needs be another reſt
beſides that earthly reſt; which yet remaines to the people of God, and a
reſt of far greater perfection.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>For if Ieſus had given them reſt, then would he
not afterward have ſpoken of another day.</hi>] Joſhua is called Jeſus by
the 70. Interpreters, and by other Greeke writers; for both thoſe names
ſignifie the ſame thing, namely, Saviour, and they differ onely in dialect.
<hi>Had given them reſt</hi>] Joſhua did give them poſſeſſion in
the land of Cannan, and thereby reſt; yet not that perfect reſt, that was
yet remaining for Gods people. <hi>He would not afterward have ſpoken of
another day.</hi>] If Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua had given them a perfect reſt, beyond which
there was none fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be expected; then certainly the holy Ghoſt, after
the people once entered and ſeated there, would not have ſpoken of another
day, wherein the people muſt enter into his reſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt to the people of
God.</hi>] From the former paſſages he concludes, that there remaines for
the people of God another reſt, after the reſt obtained in Canaan: for the
happy ſtate of Gods people doth not ſtay at that earthly reſt. This
reſt hee calls not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as by the
word he uſed hitherto: but hee calls it a Sabbatiſme; thereby to make us
underſtand, that he had reſpect to the ſeventh dayes reſt, wherein God
himſelf reſted, and commanded the Iſraelites to reſt in memory of it,
and was therefore diſtinguiſhed by the name of Sabbath, which ſignifies
reſt alſo; and alſo further to the teach us, what kinde of reſt
remaineth to the people of God, namely, a Sabbaticall reſt. i. a reſt like
to that wherewith God himſelfe reſted, whereof the feſtivall Sabbath of
the ſeventh day is a moſt ſlender ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: for therein the Iſraelites
reſted from their cares and labours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and during their earthly reſt
given them by Joſhua.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>For he that is entered into his reſt</hi>] By
theſe words hee proves, that there remaines to us a Sabbatiſme. i. ſuch a
reſt as is denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſeventh dayes reſt, in Commemoration and
Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, the perpetuall obſervation of the weekly reſt
was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61860:35"/>But this reſt conſiſteth in a
ceſſation from all works, as God alſo ceaſed from his workes. This he
proves from this reaſon, becauſe we muſt enter into Gods reſt, as
appeares by the words of the Pſalme. But to enter into Gods reſt, what is
it elſe, but to reſt after the ſame manner that God reſted, and kept
the Sabbath? <hi>He alſo hath reſted from his own works, as God did from
his.</hi>] Hath reſted is an Hebraiſme, for doth reſt; for the Hebrews
many times put the tenſe praeter for the future. When Joſhua had given the
Iſraelites an earthly reſt in the land of Canaan, they thereby had quiet
poſſeſſion and reſted from their enemies; and they had a Sabbath
alſo to reſt from their labours: but their Sabbath was not continuall and
daily, but weekly onely upon the ſeventh day of it; for the firſt ſix
dayes of the week they reſted not, but followed their labours: ſo their
Sabbatiſme was not a totall and finall reſt from labours, but their labours
were to returne upon them after one dayes reſt in a weeke. But the
Sabbatiſme that is after the image of Gods reſt, is a totall and finall
reſt from all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, never to be wearied with labour or work any more, but
is an eternall feſtivall that ſhall never expire. For theſe words may be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued with the word <hi>remaineth</hi> in the former verſe, thus.
Therefore I affirm, that there yet remaineth a reſt to the people of God:
becauſe the Iſraelites did not ſo reſt from their workes, as never to
be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with more labours afterward. But he that hath entered into Gods
reſt, whereinto (as we have already ſeen) the people of God muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he hath ſo reſted from workes as God reſted from his. For as God in
making the world, diſpatched all his works in the ſpace of ſix dayes,
never to make any more workes, ſo hee that hath entered into Gods reſt, or
the like reſt with God, he alſo hath diſpatched and finiſhed all his
workes, his labours, paines, cares, and troubles, and whatſoever is
weariſome to man in this life, and he enjoyes an eternal reſt and quiet,
joyned with eternall happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter into that
reſt,</hi>] Having ſhewed that there remaines a reſt for the people of
God, and that in the beſt and higheſt degree; he now repeates his
admonition at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the chapter, exhorting them to ſtrive with
all labour, that they may enter that reſt. The originall word for labour
ſignifies alſo haſte, to worke with haſte and diſpatch. For we muſt
make haſte in this our ſpirituall journey which leads and determines in an
eternall reſt; that is, we muſt be diligent and quick in tracing the path
of faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, not
lazy and ſlow. Becauſe wee muſt alwaies have an ardent and earneſt
affection after ſo great a bleſſing, and therefore muſt uſe all
diligence to haſten our ſelves onward and toward it, as they do that are in
a journey toward their own countrey, or toward a place moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and
acceptable to them. <hi>Into that reſt</hi>] Not into any earthly reſt, but
into that heavenly reſt proper to God himſelfe, and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61860:36"/>grace communicable to his people, and is yet remaining to
them. <hi>Leſt any man fall</hi>] We muſt therefore diligently labour after
that reſt, leſt we fall into the like deſtruction with thoſe fathers,
who periſhed and were deſtroyed in the wilderneſſe; for <hi>fall</hi>
here is put for <hi>periſh,</hi> leſt any periſh as they did. <hi>After
the ſame example of unbeliefe</hi>] If we fall after their example into the
ſame ſin, we ſhall alſo fall after their example into the ſame
judgement, and periſh as they did. We have ſeene their unbeliefe, and we
know what a world of miſeries it brought upon them: Let both theſe be
examples unto us, and let us therefore endeavour to ſhunne the rock that is
ſhewed us. The Originall word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſignifies both unbeliefe and diſobedience, and this latter more uſually;
for thoſe two ſins are ſo neere allyed in nature, that one word will
ſerve to ſignifie them both: for unbeliefe and diſobedience are either
wholly the ſame, or mutually conſequent one to another.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>For the word of God is quick</hi>] By this word
of God here, many think Chriſt is meant; but that cannot be. 1. Becauſe
Chriſt is called the Word of God onely by John, as is obſerved by
diverſe. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this word here is ſaid to be powerfull, and
ſharper then any two edged ſword; both which qualities agree rather to
things then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Others by the word of God here, underſtand the
Scripture; which cannot be neither, becauſe then there could be no genuine
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, nor congruity of reaſoning in theſe words from the former; For
how ſhould this be coherent? Let us labour to enter into that reſt, leſt
following the example of our fathers unbeliefe, we ſhould follow them alſo
in their deſtruction; becauſe the Scripture is quick and powerfull. By the
word of God therefore is meant the Decree of his Judgement, or the Menace of
God, whereby he threatens and ordaines unbeleeving and diſobedient perſons
to deſtruction and puniſhment; Of which kinde is that very Oath of God,
whereby he ſware to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude thoſe fathers, and all ſuch like as they
from entring into his reſt. For by this ſence, there is an elegant
coherence betweene this verſe and the former. Therefore let us labour to
enter into Gods reſt, and let us take heed of falling into the diſobedience
of thoſe fathers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word of God, and his oath whereby he
debarres diſobedient men from his reſt, and devotes them to deſtruction,
is quick and powerfull. This expoſition is eaſily confirmed, from diverſe
other paſſages of Scripture, wherein the Decrees of God, whereby he wils
and commands ſomething to be done, are called by like termes of his word, and
have the like attribute of being lively or quick, and the like reſemblance to
a ſharpe and two edged ſword, and diverſe the like effects. See Pſal.
105.18,19. and Pſal. 107.20. and Pſal. 147.15. and Iſaiah 40.8. and
Iſaiah 55.11. which laſt place Peter applyes to the word of the Goſpel,
becauſe therein alſo is contained the decree of God for the ſaving and
condemning of men, 1 Pet. 1.23,25. See alſo <pb n="67" facs="tcp:61860:36"/>Iſaiah
66.2,5. and Jerem. 23.29. and Joel 2.11. Now this word or Decree of God is
called quick or lively, becauſe it dies not, neither is exolete or
fruſtrated with any tract of time or age. And it is called ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall or
powerfull, becauſe it is not onely firme and ſtable, in regard God never
revokes it, or willingly changeth it, or ſuffers it to fall, as Princes often
ſuffer their words or decrees to fall, either by oblivion, negligence, or
inconſtancy: but alſo, becauſe it is of full power and force to execute
and effect all the will of God therein contained. Hence it is compared to raine
and ſnow. For as the raine commeth downe and the ſnow from heaven, and
returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and
bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater: So ſhall
my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth, it ſhall not returne unto me
void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall
proſper in the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſent it, Iſaiah 55.10,11. <hi>And
ſharper then any two edged ſword</hi>] It ſtrikes and wounds more
fearefully and deadly then any ſword how ſharpe ſoever. And in other
places of Scripture, the Decree of Chriſt againſt ungodly and diſobedient
perſons is compared to a two edged ſword going out of his mouth, or at
leaſt is ſignified by ſuch a ſword. For God and Chriſt doe deſtroy
all their enemies by their word go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their mouth, i. by their
powerfull and effectuall command. <hi>Piercing even to the dividing aſunder
of the ſoule and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow</hi>] The
ſharpeneſſe of this ſword hath firſt this effect, that it pierceth
deeply, and the effect of that piercing is to divide and cut aſunder ſoule
and ſpirit, joynts and marrow. By which words it appeares, that Gods Decree
and command is farre more ſharpe and piercing then any ſword; becauſe it
doth not onely pierce and cut the body of man, but alſo his ſoule and
ſpirit; yea, it pierceth the body in ſuch manner, that it cuts not onely
the skin and fleſh, but alſo all the joynts and bands of the member, yea
the very bones themſelves, and conſequently the marrow contained in the
bones. So that this ſword pierceth into the moſt ſecret and inmoſt
parts of man, even the ſoule, ſpirit, and marrow. In this ſence is
ſignified, that this ſword doth not onely cut the outward parts that lye
open to the eye, but alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts that are hidden from it, i. The
force of Gods decree and ſentence reacheth not onely to thoſe crimes which
are notorious and publique, as the decrees and Judgements of Magiſtrates do,
who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the power of the ſword, and therewith do execution upon
malefactors: but his decree alſo takes vengeence on thoſe ſins, which are
moſt ſecret and hidden, bordering as it were upon the confines of the
ſoule and ſpirit, and lye cloſed up as it were betweene the joynts or
within the marrow, then which places nothing can be deviſed more ſecret.
Now the ſoule is the inferiour faculty in us, containing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or
paſſions, as luſt, and wrath, reſpecting onely thoſe things 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61860:37"/>which pleaſe and content the body. Hence they which
follow this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and ſuffer themſelves to be governed by it, are called
in Scripture animall men. But the ſpirit is the ſuperiour faculty, which
diſcerns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things lawfull and unlawfull; drawing us to things lawfull
and honeſt, and driving us from the contrary, whereby we underſtand, know
God, and his will and our finall happineſſe. Although the ſpirit may
alſo be taken for that part of us, which doth firſt vivifie the body and
remaines after death. And the ſoule may be taken for life it ſelfe, or for
that faculty which flowes from the ſpirit over the whole body. <hi>And is a
diſcerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</hi>] This hee addeth,
that what hee ſaid concerning the word of God, might bee further preſſed
and the better underſtood. God doth both take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the thoughts and
intents of mens hearts, and alſo decrees them to be puniſhed if they
deſerve it. This hee therefore ſaith, leſt any man ſhould thinke, that
he may lye hid from Gods decree and eſcape the force and ſharpneſſe of
his ſentence; if he only nouriſh his unbelief in his heart, and reſerve
it in his ſecret thoughts. So that no thought of ours though never ſo
ſecret, no wavering in our faith can be concealed from God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Neither is there any creature that is not
manifeſt in his ſight.</hi>] Now he ſpeaks that more generally, whereof
before he ſpake but in particular. God doth not only diſcerne and know the
thoughts of our hearts; but there is nothing at all in the world that can
eſcape the ſight of his eye; for by creatures he underſtands all things
in generall. <hi>But all things are naked and opened unto the eyes.</hi>] He
illuſtrates what he ſaid before by the contrary to it. There is nothing
ſo covered or hidden but the ſight of his eyes can diſcover it. And eyes
are attributed to him, becauſe he clearly ſeeth all things be they never
ſo remote, and ſo leaveth nothing unpuniſhed. Opened

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This word is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
expounded; ſome thus; the whole face from head to ſhoulders is diſcovered
and expoſed to the eyes of all. Others thus; The skinne is drawne over the
ſhoulders from head to taile. Others; the creature is flayed and hanged up by
the heeles, having the belly and bowells opened to the chine of the backe, that
all lyes open both without and within. But all theſe come to one ſenſe;
namely that there is nothing ſo covered and hidden, which lyes not open to
Gods word or decree; for the ſight of his eyes doth not only fall upon the
outward covering of things, but pierceth inwardly all over their ſubſtance.
<hi>Of him with whom we have to do.</hi>] In the originall of that whereof we
ſpeake, <hi>i.</hi> of that word whereof we ſpeake. Hereby he ſhewes,
that he underſtands not any word of God in generall, but ſome certaine
word; namely that quicke and powerfull word, whereof we have hitherto ſpoken;
and which is to be underſtood in all this matter of piercing, dividing and
diſcovering.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61860:37"/>14. <hi>Seeing then that we have a
great high Prieſt.</hi>] This is the ſecond part of this Chapter, wherein
he returnes to treat of the dignity of Chriſts Prieſthood, from whence he
had digreſſed to fall upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation hitherto explicated. Now
therefore hee reſumes his former argument, and from thence drawes another
admonition for conſtancie in the Chriſtian Religion. The Prieſtly office
of Chriſt, that here we may ſpeake of it a little more fully,
conſiſteth in this, That Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piateth all our ſinnes before God,
and adminiſtreth all matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, as the chiefe Preſident
over holy things. Therefore we ſay, Chriſt hath expiated all our ſinnes,
becauſe it was the office of the high Prieſt to expiate the ſinnes, not
of one ſingle perſon only, but of the whole people. But for the manner, how
Chriſt expiates our ſinnes, there is a great difference betweene him and
the legall high Prieſt; ſo that in this reſpect Chriſt is like God, yea
in a manner ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the part of God, and not of the Prieſt: For Chriſt
remaining in heaven, doth ſo expiate our ſinnes, that by power granted him,
hee removes all puniſhment from us, and aboliſhes all things that may
involve us in any puniſhment. Whence it appeares that Prieſtly office
differs not really from his regall office, but rationally only. For Chriſt
doth not now really execute any thing about God, or performe any condition,
upon the deed whereof there followes by the decree of God a purgation of our
ſinnes; as anciently the legall Prieſt was wont to doe: For he entered into
the tabernacle of God with bloud, and there appearing before God, did
ſprinkle the bloud after a forme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him, and offered it unto God;
which being done, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expiation of ſinne upon it. For
although Chriſt ſhed his bloud upon earth, and by afflictions prepared
himſelfe for the execution of his office, to the end, that by a ſenſe of
our infirmities, hee might bee the more readily affected toward us; all which
conditions, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required of God and were firſt to be performed by
Chriſt: yet being now in heaven, and fullier adminiſtring his Prieſtly
office, in procuring the expiation of our ſinnes, he really performes no
further conditions. For in that, after his bloudſhed upon the croſſe, he
entred into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly tabernacle, and by this means offered himſelfe to
God; this was not any true condition upon which God decreed the remiſſion
of our ſinnes; ſeeing that entrance and oblation of himſelfe was a great
bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of God beſtowed upon him: but it was only a meanes whereby Chriſt
obtained ſupreme power both in heaven and earth, from whence followed the
expiation of our ſinnes, and which being granted unto Chriſt, God did
openly teſtifie, that he would not puniſh any of their ſinnes who did
belong to Chriſt. This indeed is true, that this entrance of Chriſt into
heaven and his appearance before God, have a reſemblance or likeneſſe
with the entrance of the legall Prieſt into the Sanctuary, and his appearance
before God, as God anciently required <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61860:38"/>it. Which
reſemblance or likneſſe is the cauſe, why Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with
the legall Prieſt, and carrieth his name, as we ſhall declare a little
afterward. Neither muſt we thinke, that Chriſt now inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heaven, doth
(to ſpeake properly) intercede or pray for us; for that were repugnant to his
ſupreme dominion and power over all things. Wherefore his Prieſtly office
lyes in this, that having power given him of God, he takes away the
puniſhment of our ſinnes, and by all means procures our ſalvation. And
therefore this Prieſtly office of Chriſt is really the ſame with his
regall office, as we ſaid before. Hence Chriſt as a Prieſt is ſaid to
ſave us perfectly, or rather for ever, cap. 7.25. he is alſo ſaid as a
Prieſt to ſuccour us being tempted, cap. 2. ult. and in this chapter, v.
16. Both which actions are regall. Hence it is that other holy Writers make no
expreſſe mention of Chriſts Prieſt-hood: but this Author, chap. 3. v.
1. included the regall office of Chriſt in his Prieſtly; and chap. 5. v. 5.
he interprets that teſtimony of Scripture to be meant of his Prieſtly
office, which treats of his regall. Chriſt therefore is called a high
Prieſt, not that this office is really diverſe from his regall, but
becauſe of diverſe reſemblances which Chriſt hath with the legall high
Prieſt, and of diverſe properties and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in his regall
office; upon which that reſemblance is grounded, and which that Metaphoricall
appellation of high Prieſt doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſinuate into our mindes, then the
proper appellation. The reſemblance lies chiefly in this, That Chriſt
having firſt ſhed his blood, entered into heaven to expiate our ſins, or
to take away the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which by our ſinnes we had deſerved, and
appeared before God: as the legall high Prieſt, having ſhed the blood of
the ſacrifice, was wont to enter the Tabernacle, and there appeare before
God, to expiate ſinnes, by taking away the guilt and penalty of them. But
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the high Prieſt performed this by bringing the blood of the
ſlain ſacrifice into the ſight of God, and offering it unto him with
certaine rites, and ſo interceding for finners with God, from whom the
forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes proceeded. Therefore alſo it is ſaid of
Chriſt, who was himſelfe ſlaine like a ſacrifice, and had ſhed his
owne blood, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the heavenly Tabernacle, he offered himſelfe
to God, and appearing in his ſight intercedeth for us. Not that hee doth
properly intercede, but that as wee ſaid he is like to the high Prieſt
offering and interceding; eſpecially becauſe he forgives ſinnes, not of
his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but by power received from God; whereby he is not unfitly
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with him who obtained forgiveneſſe of ſinnes from God by his
interceſſion. From hence in ſome meaſure may be gathered thoſe
properties and circumſtances of Chriſts regall office, which his
appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of high Prieſt doth better repreſent unto our mindes, then his
name of King, though this name bee proper to him, and the other Metaphoricall.
His Kingly name ſhewes not that he ſaves ſinners; but <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61860:38"/>his Prieſtly doth. That ſhewes not that he is a man (for God both
is, and is called our King) but this doth; for in the beginning of the fifth
Chapter, the Author ſhewes, That every high Prieſt is taken from among men,
and is ordained for men. That ſhewes not that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his authority and
power from another; but this doth, chap. 5. 4. That ſhewes not that he is
touched with a ſenſe of our miſeries; this doth. That ſhewes not that
he ſhed his bloud to expiate our ſinnes, but this doth; for a Prieſt
muſt offer ſacrifices for ſinnes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offered without
ſhedding of bloud: but Chriſt ſhed no bloud beſides his owne. That
ſhewes not, that he ſhall come forth from heaven; but this doth. Hence
therefore it is that the Holy Ghoſt gives Chriſt the name of High Prieſt.
<hi>A great high Prieſt.</hi>] Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a great high Prieſt, not
only to diſtinguiſh him from the ordinary and inferiour Prieſts, but
alſo from the chiefe high Prieſt under the Law, who compared to Chriſt is
very little; yea but a ſmall and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhadow of Chriſt. For he
muſt needs bee a great high Prieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who is immortall; who expiates
all ſinnes even the moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous: who hath power in himſelfe, to take
away all puniſhments of ſinne, among which eternall death is one; who hath
right and power to give eternall life, to ſuccour men in all their
afflictions, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe all with the Author in a few words, who is
ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the heavens, chap. 8.
1. which thing hee intimates alſo here when he addes in the firſt place;
<hi>That is paſſed into the heavens.</hi>] Therefore among other
reſpects, he is great, becauſe he hath paſſed through all the heavens.
By heavens are underſtood all thoſe regions of heaven, which are
interpoſed between God and us; namely: 1. The whole region of the aire, which
in the Scripture is called the heaven. 2. The heavens wherein are the Sunne,
the Moon, and the reſt of the Startes or lights of heaven; above all which
Chriſt is now exalted, Eph. 3.10. and Heb. 7.26. 3. After all theſe, is
that heaven which is the habitacle of immortality, wherein God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and
whereinto Chriſt our high Prieſt hath entered. <hi>Ieſus.</hi>] Here he
names this great high Prieſt, and ſhewes who he is; although in this be
tacitly contained, that which afterward he utters expreſly, namely, that he
is touched with a feeling of our infirmities. For when he called him Jeſus,
he called him alſo that man, whoſe ſufferings and death were evident. But
becauſe he intended to ſet firſt clearly before our eyes his
tranſcendent excellency; therefore that it might better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how great an
high Prieſt he is, he adds in the ſecond place; <hi>The Son of God.</hi>]
He calls him not a Son of God, but prefixeth the ſpecifique article, calling
him <hi>the</hi> Sonne, to ſhew that he is no ordinary Sonne of God in a
vulgar ſenſe, but that ſingular and eminent Sonne of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he of
whom he ſpake in the firſt chap. whom God appointed heire of all things,
who is become far more excellent then the Angels. For <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61860:39"/>ſo
it ought to be, that the ſingular and only Sonne of God, ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Gods greateſt love, ſhould be in higheſt dignity, and have right and
dominion over all his fathers goods. Even him we have for our high Prieſt.
Whence it appears, that Chriſt can effect all things with his Father, by
reaſon of the great love and authority which he poſſeſſeth. Wherefore
as the Author addeth; <hi>Let us hold faſt our confeſsion.</hi>] Here he
infers his admonition; that ſeeing we have ſo great an high Prieſt of our
Confeſſion; therefore let us hold our confeſſion faſt: <hi>i.</hi>
let us not only imbrace the Chriſtian Religion in our hearts but conſtantly
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it with our mouths.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>For we have not an high Prieſt,</hi>] He clears
an objection. Some man will ſay, What can this great high Prieſt helpe me
when I ſuffer miſery for the confeſſion of my faith, who the greater he
is, and the more remote from me, the leſſe is he touched with any care of
us? To this he anſwers by ſaying, that he is not ſuch a high Prieſt,
<hi>Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</hi>] Our
infirmities here ſignifie our ſufferings and troubles both of minde and
body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are afflicted for the profeſſion of our Religion.
Theſe are called our infirmities, becauſe our naturall infirmity gives way
unto them; or elſe from the effect, becauſe they make both our minde and
body infirm. For our minde doth languiſh with griefe as with a diſeaſe.
And the Author uſeth this word the rather, becauſe the legall high Prieſt
was to have a feeling of the infirmities of Gods people; although thoſe
infirmities were humane lapſes &amp; errors. Now to have a feeling of our
infirmities is to be touched with an affection and ſenſe of them.
<hi>i.</hi> with mercy which is a ſenſe of another mans miſery. <hi>That
cannot be touched,</hi> doth not ſimply here ſignifie the faculty of
compaſſion; for any Angell may have the faculty of compaſſion: but to
have both the power and readineſſe and will to compaſſionate, as wee
explicated the ſame word, chap. 2. at the laſt verſe. And it is as much
as if hee had ſaid, we have not an hard hearted high Prieſt, who is not
eaſily moved with the evills and troubles of another; as commonly ſuch are
who themſelves never had experience of evills and troubles. <hi>But was in
all things tempted like as we are.</hi>] Hee illuſtrates what kinde of high
Prieſt we have by the contrary, or rather by the cauſe of a contrary
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Becauſe he was tempted in all things, therefore he can and will be
moved with all our infirmities. By temptations are many times ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
afflictions; becauſe a man is tempted by afflictions; for they make a triall
of the ſtrength and patience that is in him. See Jam. 1.2,3. <hi>In all
points.</hi> He was afflicted with all kindes of evils; for hee had the triall
of calumnies, reproaches and bonds, of divers anguiſhes in ſoule, and
tortures of the body; yea of a fearfull and ſhamefull death. <hi>Like as we
are.</hi> There is no difference between his ſufferings and ours; for both
are all alike, as he ſaid before that he muſt be made like his brethren in 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61860:39"/>all things. <hi>Yet without ſinne.</hi>] Chriſt was
altogether innocent, and no way deſerved the evills hee ſuffered. This he
ſaid, partly to anſwer their calumny, who gave it out, that he deſerved
the puniſhment of the croſſe; partly to admoniſh other Chriſtians, to
follow innocence, and to take heed they ſuffered not as malefactors; but
rather ſtrive to bee like Chriſt, who ſuffered for no fault of his owne,
neither ſhould they refuſe to undergoe divers calamities for the name of
Chriſt, though they be innocent; nor make it a marvell, if ſuch meaſure
fall upon them that happened unto Chriſt their Lord and leader; and ſhould
thinke that Chriſt will much the ſooner ſuccour them, when they fall into
perſecutions, torments and death innocently; for the more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence they
bring with them to their ſufferings, the more ready he is to helpe them. It
is a vulgar error, to thinke, that in this place, Chriſt is ſaid to be like
us ſimply in all things ſinne onely excepted. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the words of the
Author, nor the truth of the thing will beare this ſenſe. For Chriſt was
much unlike to all us in many other points beſides ſinne, as in divine
power and wiſdome, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner of his birth. For becauſe we
ſhould not thinke, that hee ſpeaks here, of likeneſſe in nature only,
therefore ſinne is mentioned, which can no way be referred to nature.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly,</hi>] From the
ſaying before he infers another exhortation, which notwithſtanding is
ſubſervient to that hee made at the 14. verſe, and is to ſecond it.
Seeing wee enjoy ſuch a high Prieſt, that hath himſelfe had triall of all
ſorts of evill, let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his helpe boldly. In the originall it is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or rather
with free liberty of ſpeech, for here he treats of praying, and it
ſignifies not only a confident hope of the minde to obtaine our deſires;
but an audacity or undauntednes flowing from an inward confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby we
are imboldned to have our acceſſe to his throne, to ſpeake and pray unto
him. For a liberty of ſpeech then appeares in us, when neither the authority,
majeſty, or ſeverity of another, nor the feare of offence can deter us from
ſpeaking; which doth excellently ſuit with this place. For ſeeing there
is a great Majeſty of that throne, where we muſt become ſupplicants; it
might eaſily fall out, that a man being afraid thereof, and alſo
conſcious of his owne unworthineſſe, might not dare to approach that
throne, and ſupplicate to him that ſits upon it. Wherefore the Author
endeavours to encourage our mindes and raiſe us to a freedome of ſpeech,
when he ſhews us, that with ſo great a Majeſty there is joyned clemencie,
favour, and mercy, toward diſtreſſed Chriſtians. <hi>Vnto the throne of
grace.</hi>] He names not him to whoſe throne we muſt come, or that ſits
upon the throne; but becauſe he commands us to come to this throne, therefore
in that we have ſuch a high Prieſt who can have a feeling of our
infirmities, and thereupon is ready to pity and helpe us; and we muſt come
for this end that wee <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61860:40"/>may finde mercy and help; from all
theſe it appeares, that it is the throne of our high Prieſt, as it is
ſaid, Pſal. 45.6. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever. But he names a
throne, that he may repreſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, his exceeding great Majeſty and
power; that our freedome of ſpeech there ſhould not leſſen our
reverence, and that wee ſhould fully conceive him, not onely mercifull to be
willing to help us, but alſo powerfull to be able. And againe, leſt the
high throne and Majeſty of Chriſt ſhould appale our mindes, he calls it
the throne <hi>of grace</hi>] that we may conceive, though our high Prieſt,
ſit in a throne, veſted with great Majeſty, yet he is full of love and
mercy towards us. That ſo the throne and Majeſty of Chriſt might raiſe
in our mindes due reverence, and his grace and favour towards us, might
cheriſh our confidence and freedome of ſpeech to him. They who ſay, This
is the throne of God himſelf, oppoſe not us, ſeeing Chriſt ſits in
the throne of God; unleſſe happily they ſay it therefore, that they may
exclude Chriſt from this throne, againſt ſo many cleare teſtimonies of
Scripture; and the force of this paſſage alſo, thereby to wreſt from us
this argument for the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſt. This we eaſily grant, that
here we may underſtand God, no leſſe then Chriſt; and it is very likely
that this Author did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call it the throne of grace in generall, then
either of God or Chriſt in particular, that hee might leave us an equall
right and liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch either to God in the Name of our high Prieſt,
or immediatly to our high Prieſt himſelf. For whether wee goe to God in the
name of Chriſt, or to Chriſt himſelfe, we ſhall either way finde the
Throne of grace: <hi>That we may obtain mercy and find grace</hi>] The finall
cauſe of our approach to this throne, is here expreſt to be two-fold;
whereof one is a meane to the other, the former to the latter; The former is to
obtain mercy and finde grace; the other is, opportune help in time of need. To
obtaine mercy is nothing elſe, then to get that another have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on thee; which is eaſily got from a mercifull perſon, ſuch as this our
high Prieſt. To finde grace, is to be gracious with another, and to be
favoured with a peculiar affection of love. In this ſence, the Angell tells
Mary, that ſhe had found grace with God, Luke 1.30. And it is an eaſie
matter to finde grace and favour with him, who is moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and
favourable. <hi>To help in time of need.</hi>] In the originall it is, for
opportune help. The laſt finall cauſe of our approaching this Throne, and
finding grace there, is for opportune help; That Chriſt may help us in our
conflicts of godlineſſe and patience, that we ſink not under our
temptations and afflictions; eſpecially, that at our laſt gaſpe, he may
receive our ſpirits into his hands, preſerve them for us, and reſtore
them at his comming; whereof ſee the following chapter, v. 7.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or every high Prieſt is taken from among
men,</hi>] Here he expreſſeth ſome generall requiſites of a high
Prieſt, which afterward hee applyes to Chriſt in a reverſe order. The
firſt requiſite of a high Prieſt is this, that he is a Man ſingled out
from among other men; and that, for this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reaſon, becauſe he is
ordained for men. <hi>i.</hi> for the benefit and good of men. This firſt
property of a high Prieſt, he toucheth only by the way, and by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of
the following property; and withall ſeems to reflect upon ſome former
paſſages wherein he had proved that Chriſt muſt be a man and not ſome
angel. And therefore when afterward hee applies the following properties of a
high Prieſt unto Chriſt, hee makes no mention of this, as having
ſufficiently diſcuſſed it already in the ſecond <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61860:41"/>chapter. <hi>Is ordained for men</hi>] The dignity and office of high
Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is created and conſtituted for the commodity and benefit of
men. <hi>In things pertaining to God</hi>] Divine and holy things pertaining to
God, are the matter or object of his function or office; that he may procure
and adminiſter all things belonging to the worſhip of God, and to make him
propitious to them that worſhip him. <hi>That he may offer both gifts and
ſacrifices for ſins</hi>] Theſe particularly are the things whereby God
is worſhipped and propitiated. Gifts are free-will offerings, ſuch as the
people were accuſtomed to offer of their owne accord; for the Law did not
command the act of theſe offerings, but when they were freely offered, then
the Law preſcribed the matter and manner of their offering. Of this ſort
were thoſe ſacrifices which were called Peace-offerings, whereof wee may
reade in the three firſt chapters of Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. Theſe were offered, either
to procure the favour of God, and as it were to obliege him with a preſent,
or to teſtifie their mindfull and thankfull hearts for ſome benefit
received. Yet ſometime the word Gifts are taken more largely for all ſorts
of ſacrifices, and then it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the ſin-offerings. For, Chriſt under
the name of gifts, ſeemes to compriſe all things that were laid upon the
Altar, and offered unto God, Mat. 23.18. Sacrifices for ſins, were living
creatures, which by preſcript of the Law were offered to God, to take away
the guilt of ſinne, whereof we may reade, Levit. 4. and elſewhere. The
words [<hi>for ſins</hi>] may be ſo taken, as to be conſtrued onely with
the ſacrifices immediately fore-mentioned. Yet there is no incongruity, if we
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them alſo to the remoter word <hi>of gifts</hi>] For although ſins
might be expiated, and their guilt taken away without ſuch gifts; for
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they had not beene truly gifts, but debts: Yet there can be
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid to the contrary, but that beſides the ſacrifices ordained
of God for the expiation of ſins, there might be offered for ſins alſo
vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary gifts and free-will offerings. For, hence we reade, that expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſinne was attributed to the Holocauſt, which was reckoned among the
peace offerings, Levit. 1.4. And hereto David had reſpect, when ſpeaking of
the expiation of his ſin, he ſaid he would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Holocauſts, or
whole burnt offerings, if they had beene any thing availeable to expiates
ſuch ſins, Pſal. 51.16. This therefore is the chiefe property of a high
Prieſt, to negotiate the cauſe of men with God, eſpecially of ſuch men
as had ſinned, and to provide that God might be propitiated and pacified, not
left angry and offended. And this is the ſecond property required in an high
Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Who can have compaſsion on the ignorant</hi>]
This is the third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. A compaſſionate man, as ſome Interpreters
note, is he that carrieth himſelfe humanely, moderately and gently. Therefore
he hath compaſſion on the ignorant, who beares himſelfe gently towards
them, not deſpiſing, nor diſdaining them for their falls; but doth 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61860:41"/>friendly and courteouſly raiſe them, not unmindfull of
his owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Ignorant are they who ſin through ignorance; and
ignorance as it is vulgarly diſtinguiſhed, is either of the Law, or of the
fact; and this latter is held to make the fact excuſable, and not the former.
But indeed there is alſo an ignorance of Law, that deſerves ſome
excuſe; namely, when the number of Laws are become ſo great, that they can
neither be comprehended in minde, nor retained in memory; and eſpecially when
the Laws are not grounded upon naturall honeſty, or the dictates of right
reaſon, but upon the ſole will and pleaſure of the Legifer. For, in
ſuch Laws the minde and memory doth eaſily faile, eſpecially ſeeing all
mens capacities are not equall. Now both theſe conſiderations tooke place
in the Laws of Moſes; for their number was ſo great, that it exceeded ſix
hundred; and the ground of them ſuch, that moſt of them depended not upon
naturall honeſty and right reaſon, but upon the ſole will and poſitive
pleaſure of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſins committed through ignorance of Law, if
any way they were excuſable, were expiated under the Law by preſcript of
Law, and without doubt are here by the Author called Ignorances. <hi>And on
them that are out of the way</hi>] On the Errant. The word Errant is either the
ſame with the ignorant; or if it differ, the difference is this, that the
ignorant are ſuch as miſtake in the Law; and the Errant ſuch as miſtake
in the fact, or the circumſtances of it; and the ſin thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is
called an Errour. Or rather by Errour is noted not ſo much the errour of the
minde, as the errour in the action. So that by errours are meant, not onely
thoſe treſpaſſes that proceed from ſome errour of the minde; but
alſo thoſe which flow from humane frailty, though there precede no errour
in the minde, and are committed in matters that in their owne nature are but of
light importance. And there is no doubt, but the Author by theſe two words of
Ignorances and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, would comprehend all lighter treſpaſſes, not
committed out of meere malice of minde, or (as the Scripture termes it) by a
high hand; but were done either out of excuſable ignorance, or of humane
frailty in things of leſſe moment; for which onely the benefit of expiation
was granted under the Law. This affection and compaſſion toward them that
ſin of ignorance or frailty, (and not of malice and contempt) though it be no
leſſe in Chriſt our high Prieſt, then anciently it was in the Legall
high Prieſt; yet in the reddition of this compariſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſpeakes
of Chriſt, this compaſſion is concluded to be in Chriſt; neither is the
compariſon brought for that purpoſe, but onely it is to ſhew the
compaſſion and pitty that Chriſt beares toward the afflicted and
diſtreſſed. And this appeares plainly from that which is here
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned touching the efficient cauſe of this compaſſion; for it
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>For that he himſelfe is compaſſed with infirmity</hi>] He
ſhews the cauſe and fountaine of this compaſſion, which in the Legall
high <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61860:42"/>Prieſt, was his infirmity in ſin; but in Chriſt
it was his infirmity in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <hi>i.</hi> the Legall high Prieſt was
infirme, becauſe himſelfe alſo might fall through ignorances and errours:
but Chriſt was infirme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſubject to afflictions and trials
no leſſe then another man. That infirmity in the Legall high Prieſt bred
in them compaſſion and gentleneſſe towards the ignorant and errant;
this in Chriſt our high Prieſt, bred in him a compaſſion toward the
afflicted and diſtreſſed. Beſides, the Legall high Prieſt was
encompaſſed with infirmities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; but Chriſt onely for ſome time;
and there was good cauſe for both. For the Legall high Prieſt, becauſe he
was yearely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his offering for the ſinnes of the people: but
Chriſt, becauſe by one oblation he expiated for ever all the ſins of the
faithfull, therefore he was compaſſed with infirmity but once onely, and
that before his owne oblation. For that a man ſhould be prone to pitty, he
need not be perpetually in miſery; for it is ſufficient, that once he made
triall of miſery: but to the end he may help thoſe that are in miſery,
and having delivered them from their miſery, might actually make them happy
for ever, it is neceſſary that he himſelfe be preſſed with no further
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but that he be bleſſed, to the end he may be able alwayes to
help others. And this ability is not a ſimple faculty to help or have
com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſion, but a will and readineſſe to doe it, as was before
explicated, chap. 2. ver. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And by reaſon hereof,</hi>] The fourth property
of a high Prieſt is taken from his owne infirmity; for by reaſon thereof,
he muſt offer no leſſe for his owne ſinnes, then for the ſins of the
people. By reaſon hereof, <hi>i.</hi> By reaſon of his infirmity; for the
high Prieſt through his infirmity might fall into ignorances and errours; and
therefore it is likely, yea almoſt neceſſary, that he did often fall into
then. <hi>Hee ought as for the people, ſo alſo for himſelfe to offer for
ſins.</hi>] His infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in falling into ſinnes of ignorance and errour,
was a cauſe to make him offer for his owne ſinnes, not onely at particular
times, when he ſtood guilty in his conſcience of ſome particular ſin;
but yearely alſo at the ſolemne time, though then his conſcience were
touched with no particular ſin, yet then he muſt offer for thoſe ſins
whereof his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never tooke notice. In like manner, the infirmity of
Chriſt, <hi>i.</hi> not onely his paſſible nature, from whence
ſufferings flow not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily; but his ſtate and condition of
ſuffering, whereinto he was put by Gods decree, was a cauſe that he alſo
ſhould offer for himſelfe, while he was in his afflictions and miſeries.
And theſe afflictions in Chriſt, are in this compariſon anſwerable to
the finnes of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent high Prieſt, and therefore by a little abuſion
of the word, are tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehended with them under the ſole name of
ſinnes. That the Legall high Prieſt was to offer no leſſe for his owne
ſinnes, then for the peoples; yea firſt for his owne ſinnes before the
peoples, it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61860:42"/>appeares, Levit. 16.6,11,17. &amp;c.
His offering for his owne ſinnes was a young Bullock, and for the peoples, a
Hee-Goate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid afterward, that he was to enter the
Sanctuary by the bloud of Goates and Calves, chap. 9.12. But how Chriſt
offered for himſelfe, is explicated in this chap. ver. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelfe</hi>]
The fifth property of the high Prieſt, that no man muſt arrogate the office
to himſelfe, and uſurpe upon the rights of it of his owne authority. This
office here is called an honour, becauſe of the dignity of it; for offices
are of diverſe kindes: ſome are meerely ſervile, others profitable onely,
a third ſort are honourable, that draws dignities and precedency with it. Now
the office of the Prieſthood is of this laſt ſort, and therefore is
called an honour. <hi>But he that is called of God</hi>] He onely hath a right
to adminiſter in the honourable office of Prieſthood, that is deſigned
and called by God to take it upon him. This he illuſtrates by the example of
Aarons calling. <hi>As was Aaron.</hi>] Aaron did not of his owne accord
intrude himſelfe into the office of high Prieſthood, but being thereto
enjoyned and commanded by God, he accepted of it by way of obedience to him
that enjoyned it. For God firſt did chooſe Aaron, and after him his
eldeſt ſon, and by proper Laws determined the rights of ſucceſſion in
this office, which were alwayes obſerved, while the ſtate was adminiſtred
by the Laws of God. Hitherto he hath ſpecified ſeverall properties of the
high Prieſt, all which may be reduced to three heads. The firſt is, that he
offer for ſinnes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate the cauſe of men with God; to which this
may be referred that he muſt be a man. 2. That he muſt be mercifull and
propenſe toward ſinners; whereto this belongs, that he himſelfe be
compaſſed with infirmity, and thereupon offer for his owne ſinnes, as
well as for the peoples. 3. That he muſt be called to this office of God
himſelfe. Now in an order retrograde or reverſe, beginning with the laſt,
he demonſtrates that all theſe agree with Chriſt. Whence it followes,
that Chriſt hath a truly Prieſtly dignity, which he received from God; and
is touched with ſingular compaſſion toward the afflicted, and will afford
his owne people, not onely opportune helpe, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelfe to be
made an high Prieſt,</hi>] Hee begins now with the laſt property of the
high Prieſt, and ſhewes that it agrees with Chriſt; becauſe Chriſt
did not arrogate to himſelfe the honour of this office. This he doth to no
other end, then thereby to ſhew, that the Prieſthood of Chriſt was true
and lawfull; and that Chriſt had not been a true Prieſt, if he had
aſſumed this office of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not been called of God to receive
it. If I (ſaith Chriſt) glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rifie my ſelfe, my glory is nothing; it is my
Father that glorifies mee. By the like reaſon, willing to aſſert the
truth of his doctrine, hee denies <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61860:43"/>that he ſpake of
himſelfe, but refers his doctrine to his Father, and profeſſeth that he
received it from his Father; thereby intimating that his doctrine had not been
true, had hee ſpoken it of himſelfe. That which the Author ſaith here of
Chriſt is ſo much the more remarkable becauſe the Prieſthood which
Chriſt ſuſtaineth is of that nature, that no man can poſſibly take it
upon him, no man can poſſibly have but he upon whom God collates it. But
ſome man under the Law might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate the legall Prieſthood, and ſome
did arrogate it, when their ſtate was corrupt. But this high Prieſthood of
Chriſt, to miniſter eternally in the Sanctuary of heaven, to have
abſolute power and authority to take away from us all puniſhments of our
ſinnes; to ſuccour and helpe us in our miſeries; to deliver us from
death, and tranſlate us to eternall life (for theſe are the functions of
his high Prieſthood) no mortall man can challenge this Prieſthood, or
uſurpe it, or execute the functions of it, unleſſe God himſelfe
qualifie and raiſe him to ſuch high faculties. Therefore alſo the Author,
ſpeaking of Chriſt and his high Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, uſed the word
<hi>glorified,</hi> that Chriſt glorified not himſelfe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the
Prieſthood of Chriſt is a moſt glorious office, containing moſt
glorious functions, all tending to eternall glory. Hence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that Chriſt is not ſupreme God; for if he were ſo, from whom elſe could
he receive this glory but from himſelfe? But this the Author plainly denyes,
ſhewing that otherwiſe hee could not bee a true and lawfull high Prieſt;
and therefore he was not the ſupreme God. And we will paſſe by this point
alſo, that the ſupreme God can no way bee a Prieſt. <hi>But he that
ſaid unto him, Thou art my Sonne, to day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee.</hi>] The
Author ſaith not barely, that Chriſt was made a high Prieſt by God, but
preſently produceth Gods edicts, wherein he ordained Chriſt to be a high
Prieſt; from whence it manifeſtly appears that Chriſt did not arrogate
the Prieſthood to himſelfe, but was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained into it by God himſelfe.
The firſt of theſe edicts is taken out of Pſalme 2. The other Pſal.
110. That theſe words were ſpoken of God himſelfe, no man can bee
ignorant: but in theſe very words Chriſt is ordained high Prieſt; whence
it manifeſtly follows, that hee tooke not this dignity from himſelfe, but
received it of God. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former of theſe teſtimonies we have
ſpoken ſufficiently, chap. 1.5. We ſhall here note only three things. 1.
That the God who or dained Chriſt to be high Prieſt, was the Father of
Chriſt. For the Father only hath power to call Chriſt by the name of his
Sonne, as in theſe words he did. Whence it appeares that Chriſt in this
place how great ſoever he be, yea as he is the Sonne of God, is oppoſed to
God; and it and of him it is denyed that he tooke the Prieſthood to
himſelfe. 2. That the Prieſtly office of Chriſt is not really
diſtinguiſhed from his Kingly; becauſe theſe words of the Pſalme,
Thou art my Sonne, to day have I begotten thee; which as we ſaw in the
firſt chap. treat of <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61860:43"/>Chriſts Kingly dignity, in regard
whereof he is chiefly the Sonne of God, are by the Author in this place applyed
to his Prieſthood. Wee may further adde here, That Chriſt performed not his
Prieſtly office, at leaſt not perfectly, at the time when hee ſuffered
the death of the Croſſe; neither was his death a perfect oblation
expiatory; for theſe words of the Pſalme are cleerly interpreted by St.
Paul of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and glory, Act. 13. and here above, chap. 1. But
Chriſt in his death was moſt deeply humbled and debaſed. Whereas in
theſe words of the Pſalme he is declared the Sonne of God, and withall
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came far more excellent then the Angels, as appeares before chap. 1.4,5. But
in reſpect of his death, moſt eſpecially, he was much leſſe then the
Angels. As Chriſt ſuffered death, hee exerciſed not his Kingly office,
but only did that, whereby he might attaine it: but when hee adminiſters his
Prieſtly office, he withall executes the parts of his Kingly function.
Wherefore hee did not execute it actually in his death, but was thereby
prepared to execute it. 3. In thoſe words of the Pſalme, Thou art my Sonne,
to day have I begotten thee; there is no intimation of any generation or
begetting of Chriſt from the eſſence of his Father before all worlds; but
of ſuch a generation whereby Chriſt was ordained a high Prieſt of God;
and therefore of ſuch a one as was done in time; for Chriſt was not made
our high Prieſt from all eternity, but from a certaine time; namely upon his
Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>As he ſaith alſo in another place,</hi>] The
other teſtimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhewing the decree of God, taken Pſal. 110.
Hee ſaith, <hi>i.</hi> God ſaith. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever,</hi>]
In this teſtimony, there is expreſſe treating of Chriſts Prieſthood.
Whence it appeares, that it was alſo treated of in the former teſtimony;
ſeeing both the teſtimonies are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for the ſame thing. Some men
(that they may elude the true ſenſe of the former teſtimony, which the
Holy Ghoſt ſhewes to be in the words, Thou art my Sonne, To day have I
begotten thee) ſay, that thoſe words are not alleadged as a teſtimony of
Gods collating the Prieſthood upon Chriſt, but as a deſcription of him,
who conferred this office upon him. There men doe a manifeſt injury to the
truth and to the words of the Author. For how ſhould theſe following words
agree with the former, <hi>as he ſaith alſo in another place?</hi> doth hee
not by theſe latter words manifeſtly declare, that now another place or
Pſalm is cited by him; wherein the ſame point is proved, for which the
former teſtimony was produced? <hi>For ever.</hi>] The Prieſtood of
Chriſt ſhall laſt for ever in the perſon of Chriſt, without ever
having any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour in his office; for his office ſhall laſt as
long as there needs any expiation for ſinnes, even to the end of the world;
and ſo long he ſhall continue in that office. <hi>After the order of
Melchiſedeck.</hi>] The duration or terme of Chriſts Prieſthood ſhall
runne out like the duration of Melchiſedecks Prieſthood; or as the Author
expreſſeth himſelfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61860:44"/>chap. 7.15. after the
ſimilitude of Melchiſedeck. But of theſe words we ſhall ſpeake
further, chap. 7. where the Author explicates this likeneſſe more fully.
But here he tacitly meets with a doubt which ſome man might imagine touching
the Prieſthood of Chriſt, in that Chriſt deſcended not from the family
of Aaron or tribe of Levi, to which tribe the Prieſthood was limited by the
Law of God. For the type of Melchiſedeck doth not only require an eternall
Prieſthood, but alſo requires, that no reſpect of tribe or family
ſhould be had therein; as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Who in the dayes of his fleſh,</hi>] From the
third property required in a high Prieſt, and concluded to agree with
Chriſt, he aſcends now to the ſecond property, and ſaith that Chriſt
alſo was compaſſed with infirmity, and by reaſon thereof offered for
himſelfe; This he ſhews in this 7. verſe, and then at the 8. verſe, he
inferres, that from this infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chriſt learned to be mercifull toward the
diſtreſſed and afflicted. <hi>In the dayes of his fleſh.</hi>] By
fleſh hee underſtands the infirmity of Chriſt; for fleſh is the
ſubject of infirmity, and in a manner the cauſe of it. And the dayes of his
fleſh are the dayes wherein he ſuffered, for in that time chiefly his
infirmity moſt appeared. For then it moſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Chriſt was
fleſh. <hi>When he had offered prayers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>] Now he
ſhews, that Chriſt offered alſo for himſelfe. Of which his oblation,
his infirmity, and afflictions were the cauſe; the ſence whereof how
deepely it ſtruck into his ſoule, and how greatly it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed him,
appeares from the things which he offered. For he ſhews diſtinctly both
what he offered, and to whom; as alſo the adjunct of his offering, and the
iſſue of it. The matter of his offering was <hi>Prayers;</hi> This is a
generall word to ſignifie all petitions, or rather all kinde of ſpeech unto
God. <hi>And ſupplications;</hi> which are the prayers or petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of
ſupplicants, whoſe manner is to fall upon their knees, caſting
themſelves at the feet or touching the knees of them to whom they make their
prayer. The originall word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which as ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters note, doth properly ſignifie an olive-branch,
wrapped about with wooll, which ſupplicants held in their hands. Hence we may
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily imagine, in what anguiſh of ſoule Chriſt was, and what pangs of
paine he felt, when he was driven to ſuch earneſt prayers and devout
ſupplications. But what prayers and ſupplications the Author means, will
appeare from the words following; wherein the perſon to whom he prayed is
deſcribed in ſuch manner, that thence wee may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what
he prayed; although the adjunct of his prayer doth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo declare it.
<hi>Vnto him that was able to ſave him from death,</hi>] In theſe words he
ſhews, not only the perſon to whom Chriſt offered, but alſo the cauſe
why he offered him prayers, and what the thing was for which he ſo
earneſtly prayed. And this is the cauſe, why he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe God after
this manner, rather then ſimply name him; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61860:44"/>he ſo devoutly ſupplicated to God; becauſe God onely is hee that
can ſave from death; which Chriſt by his prayers chiefly requeſted. He
indeed requeſted ſome other things beſides; for in the garden hee
petitioned that the cup might paſſe from him, <hi>i.</hi> he there was an
hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupplicant proſtrate upon his knees, and afterward on his face,
pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe and againe with great ardour of minde, that hee might be
delivered from the great anguiſh and heavineſſe which hee felt in his
ſoule. And hanging upon the croſſe, he poured forth this lamentation unto
God, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>] Wherein hee
prayed that God would put an eaſe and an end to his extreme paines. But the
ſumme and breviate, or at leaſt the head of all thoſe prayers, was this,
for his delivery from death: For hee that is delivered from death, in that
ſence that Chriſt here deſired, hee hath found an end of all paines both
of ſoule and body, and hath obtained ſupreme happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This delivery
Chriſt prayed for, in commending his Spirit to God, when he was ready to
expire. For to commend the ſpirit to God, or to pray that God would receive
it into his hands; what is it elſe but to pray that he would preſerve it,
and afterward reſtore it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to recal him from death to
life, whoſe ſpirit it is? That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had reſpect to theſe prayers
of Chriſt, it may appeare by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, which he alſo mentions in
ſaying, That his prayers were offered up, <hi>With ſtrong crying and
teares.</hi>] The holy Hiſtory of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts doe teſtifie, that
Chriſt hanging upon the Croſſe, complained in the words of the Pſalme,
with a great cry that God had forſaken him, and afterward being ready to
expire, he commended his Spirit to God. But the Sacred Hiſtory mentions not
any teares of Chriſt ſhed at that time; yet notwithſtanding it appeares
that it was ſo, and was knowne to the Authour to bee ſo. Now this cry and
teares doe further ſhew how deepely the ſence of paine was impreſſed
into him, when it forced him to expreſſe ſuch cryes and teares. Hence it
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares further, that Chriſt thus exerciſed with ſo great a ſence of
paines himſelfe, cannot but be moved at the miſeries and paines of his
people, cannot but willingly hear the dolefull cryes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, and
affoord his opportune ſuccour and help in their afflictions and
diſtreſſes. From theſe words of the Authour it appeares, how Chriſt
offered for himſelfe, namely, that hee offered not himſelfe, but his
prayers for himſelfe, and then he offered them, not when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came immortall
in his heavenly Tabernacle, but in the dayes of his fleſh or infirmity. For
when he became immortall, he could not then offer for this end, that he might
be ſaved from death, which (as wee have cleared from the words of the
Authour) was indeed the end of his offering. Beſides, being in heaven he
offered himſelfe immaculate, and therefore had no need to offer for
himſelfe there. Wherefore Chriſt offered one way for himſelfe, and
another way for us: for for <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61860:45"/>himſelfe hee offered prayers
on earth; for us he offered himſelfe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for himſelfe when yet he
was mortall, or in the dayes of his fleſh: for us, when he was made an
immortall and eternall Spirit. <hi>And was heard</hi>] The effect and iſſue
of theſe prayers offered, was this, that he was delivered and ſaved, not
from death; for hee ſuffered it and dyed, but out of death from whence he was
raiſed. For whom God heareth praying in that manner, him he delivers and
frees, though not from his miſery before he ſuffer it, yet out of it after
hee hath ſuffered. So ſpeakes David as a type of Chriſt, Pſal. 22.21.
Thou haſt heard mee from the hornes of the Vnicornes. <hi>i.</hi> as learned
men have noted, thou haſt heard to ſave me from extreame dangers. So that
the word <hi>heard</hi> is taken here Metonymically, to include the effect of
his hearing; hee was heard and ſaved. <hi>In that he feared</hi>] Hee was
ſaved from, or, out of the thing hee feared, namely, out of death. The
originall is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſome take
for a paſſionate feare, the object whereof here in Chriſt was death, and
ſo by a Metonymie feare, is here put for death, the act for the object, or
thing to be feared. For of all terrours death is moſt terrible and fearfull:
and this feare was the cauſe of his prayers and ſupplications, at leaſt
of the cryes and teares wherewith they were offered. And then this example of
Chriſt may teach us, partly with what fervency of ſoule we muſt implore
the help of God in the times of our diſtreſſes; partly what things
eſpecially we muſt pray for; partly wherein that opportune help chiefly
conſiſts, (whereof the Author ſpake in the end of the former chapter)
namely, in this, that Chriſt ſaveth us out of death, into eternall life.
Others take <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for a reverentiall or
religious feare: for this ſence is ſet in the margent of our laſt
tranſlation: that he was heard <hi>for his pietie.</hi> And then the object
of his pietie, reverence or fear, was God to whom he prayed. And ſo this
feare of God, was the proper motive to this offering of Chriſt, and to all
the circumſtances of his offering. His offering it ſelfe proceeded from his
pietie or feare of God; for every offering is an act of pietie. His prayers and
ſupplications proceeded from it; for prayer alſo is an act of pietie; his
cryes and teares proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it; for they alſo are concurrents of pietie
and fervent devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His exaudition in being heard of God proceeded from it:
for Gods hearing of our prayers is the fruit of our pietie and devotion;
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God heareth not impious and ſinfull perſons, but ſuch as are
pious to reverence and worſhip him, and doe his will, thoſe hee heareth,
John 9.31. The prayers of Chriſt were ſupplications. <hi>i.</hi> (as before
is noted) petitions exhibited upon the knees with great worſhip and reverence
given to God. His prayers in the garden were ſuch ſupplications performed
with great worſhip and reverence, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward God; for firſt hee fell
upon his knees, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hee went more humbly and fell upon his face. And
his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61860:45"/>on the croſſe were ſupplications alſo
(as the Author termeth them) and therefore performed with reverent bowing
alſo; ſuch as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Chriſt to uſe in that caſe being
ſtretched and nailed upon the croſſe; where becauſe he could not bow
his knees, therefore (as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſtory relates it) hee bowed his head,
when hee cryed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his ſpirit unto God. Which bowing of his head
was not a ſimple act of a dying man, (as ſome Interpreters ſlightly
paſſe it over) but an act of worſhip and reverence of a pious man, that
was making his offering unto God by prayers and ſupplications, adding cryes
and teares, and all religious meanes, for exaudition that God might heare him.
Wherefore it carries a very congruous ſence to ſay that Chriſt was heard
for his pietie, <hi>i.</hi> for the feare and reverence he uſed toward God in
his prayers and ſupplications; for fear is the inward motion of the ſoule,
from which the outward worſhip and reverend bowings of the body do proceed.
And theſe outward reverences of bowing the head, bowing the body, and bowing
the knees, are acts of worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; which have beene uſed by Gods
people in all ages of the world. For bowing the head, See Gen. 24.26.48. and
Exod. 4.31. and Exod. 12.27. and Exod. 34.8. and 1. Chro. 29.20. and 2. Chro.
20.18. and 2. Chro. 29.30. and Nehem. 8.6. Hence it appeares alſo from this
example of Chriſt; that our prayers and ſupplications unto God, ſhould
proceed from inward piety and fear of God; and ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto him
with outward worſhip and reverence, accompanyed with cryes and teares in
times of extreme diſtreſſes; if we mean to have exaudition, that God
ſhould graciouſly heare us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Who though he were a ſon</hi>] Chriſt by the
evils which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, became ſuch a one, as to have compaſſion on
thoſe, who labour to obey God through difficulties and ſufferings. <hi>Hee
learned obedience</hi>] He learned what it is to obey God; what a difficult and
harſh duty it is, how bitter and unpleaſing to fleſh and blood. For in
this place hee takes obedience for that part of obedience, which is ſeene in
difficult and hard caſes, ſuch as are theſe, to be afflicted and ſuffer
death for the juſtice and truth of God. Yet I conceive the word obedience is
here to be underſtood more literally and derivatively from audience; for a
giving of audience. Chriſt, who upon his prayers and ſupplications made to
God, with cryes and teares to ſave him from death, had audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, and
was heard therein, did therby learne to give audience and hearing to his
people, when in their diſtreſſes they offer up prayers and
ſupplications with cryes and teares to him; thereby to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on them, and deliver them from their diſtreſſes. For
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is here fitly renderd
obedience, doth carry an elegant ſymploce of ſence, both of audience to
heare another what he would have done, and of obedience to doe the thing which
he hath heard. And that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of compaſſion in Chriſt in hearing the
diſtreſſed, though <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61860:46"/>it be his audience to them; yet it
is his obedience to God, who ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a high Prieſt for that function.
<hi>By the things that hee ſuffered.</hi>] In the originall it is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of or from the things that he
ſuffered; ſo it is rendred, Mat. 24.32. Learne a parable of the figtree.
Chriſt by or from his owne evills and ſufferings learned what
bitterneſſe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there lyes in ſuffering perſecutions for
righteouſneſſe ſake; and therefore cannot but bee affected with like
ſenſe of trouble, at the troubles and pains of the innocent, that ſuffer
for his ſake; and therefore when they pray and cry unto him, hee will be
ready in obedience to God to give them audience to heare and helpe them.
<hi>Though he were a Son,</hi>] He illuſtrates the matter <hi>ex
adverſis.</hi> So great a conjunction of Chriſt with God, ſuch a fatherly
love of God toward him as being his only Sonne, might ſeeme to be againſt
this way of exerciſing him upon the ſtage of afflictions, yet it was not
againſt it. God might have taught his Sonne the leſſons of obedience in
ſome other ſchoole then that of afflictions; yet it pleaſed God to
chooſe this way, and not ſpare him from the common condition of his
brethren. Hence it is manifeſt, how greatly God loved mankinde, who would
handle his owne Son ſo hardly to this end, that having triall of ſuffering
in his owne perſon, <hi>miſeris ſuccurrere diſcat,</hi> he might
thereby learne to ſuccour thoſe in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Hence it appeares alſo,
that Gods fatherly love to the faithfull is no way impaired, when he
exerciſeth their faith and patience to make trials of them in ſufferings.
For whom he loveth he chaſteneth and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth,
chap. 12.6.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And being made perfect</hi>] In the laſt place,
he comes to the firſt property of an high Prieſt, and applies it alſo to
Chriſt; namely, that Chriſt procures the ſalvation of men, and negotiates
with God, to be propitious to them, and forgive them the puniſhments of their
ſinnes. Which property in reſpect of Chriſt, he expreſſeth in theſe
words, that he is become the Author of eternall ſalvation. <hi>Made
perfect.</hi> This ſtate of Chriſt in being made perfect or conſummate,
is oppoſed to his ſtate <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh</hi>] For then when
Chriſt was infirme, and himſelfe wanted anothers help, he could not
perfectly and finally help others in all things. But after that he was
conſummated or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <hi>i.</hi> after he had attained to immortality,
or a nature incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and was inveſted with ſupreme power in heaven
and earth, ſo that nothing further was wanting to him; or after hee was
throughly conſecrated of God, and fully inſtalled into his Prieſthood (as
ſome think the word perfected to mean) then <hi>he became the author of
eternall ſalvation,</hi>] For then he was a moſt perfect cauſe of
ſalvation. In the dayes of his fleſh he was indeed the cauſe of eternall
ſalvation; for then he was the great Legate or Apoſtle of God to preach it:
but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfected, he becomes the moſt perfect cauſe of it; for now hee
is our high Prieſt and heavenly King, to give that, which before he
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61860:46"/>He is therefore the moſt perfect cauſe of
eternall ſalvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gives it in a moſt perfect manner; for he
wants nothing, neither for faculty or power, nor for deſire and will to
perfect our eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For by his power, he takes from us all
puniſhment of our ſins; he gives us everlaſting life; he receives our
ſpirits into his hands; he ſpeedily ſuccours us in our afflictions,
leſt our faith ſhould fail, and we thereby fall into puniſhments due to
our ſinnes. The Author made choice of generall words to deſcribe the power
and efficacie of Chriſts Prieſthood, in the procuring of our ſalvation,
that he might expreſſe it with tearms more proper to it. For Chriſt is
not the cauſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the very ſame manner with the legall high
Prieſt; who gave not ſalvation or pardon to the people himſelfe of
himſelfe as Chriſt doth, but only procured God to give it, by propitiating
him with offerings. And there is a great difference betweene Chriſt and the
legall high Prieſt in the ſalvation procured; for hee procured only a
temporary and tranſitory ſalvation, but Chriſt gives an eternall
ſalvation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore this place affoords us an example of a rule in
Scripture, that ſome things are ſaid to be ſimply done, when they are
more perfectly done. We have an inſtance hereof in that paſſage of John,
2.11. where the Diſciples of Chriſt, who did already believe in Chriſt,
are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſaid to believe in Chriſt upon ſight of the
miracle of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turned into wine; becauſe then they believed in him much
more ſtedfaſtly and perfectly then they did before, or becauſe then their
faith received a great increaſe. So Chriſt himſelfe (John 15.8.) ſaith
to his Diſciples, that if they did beare much fruit, ſo they ſhould bee
his Diſciples; becauſe by this meanes, they ſhould become his Diſciples
in a more perfect manner. This we therefore notifie, leſt to any it ſhould
ſeeme ſtrange, that the Scripture notes divers times wherein Chriſt
became the Sonne of God; namely becauſe he became ſo in a more perfect
manner and higher degree; although from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his conception he was
truly the Son of God; though not ſo perfectly as afterwards. <hi>Vnto all
them that obey him.</hi>] Here the perſons are ſpecified to whom Chriſt
is the author of ſalvation; namely to the obedient, and to them
univerſally, to all that obey him. For Chriſt is an high Prieſt properly
to ſuch, and is ordained of God to expiate their ſinnes. Whence it
appeares, that all who will have their ſins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated by Chriſt, and
obtaine eternall ſalvation by him, muſt obey him. Chriſt indeed is the
cauſe of ſalvation even to them, who as yet obey him not, in that he
firſt makes them obedient, and conſequently ſaves them: but to ſuch he
is but the remote cauſe; but he is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of it to them that
actually obey him; for therein his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office is actually exerciſed.
Not unlike to this is that ſaying of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Act. 5.31. Him hath God exalted
with his right hand to bee a Prince and a Saviour; what elſe is this, then to
be the author or cauſe <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61860:47"/>of ſalvation? and by what means
Chriſt doth worke and cauſe ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Peter expreſſeth in the words
following, to give repentance to Iſrael and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.
This latter way of ſaving, as being the perfecter, is contained in this
place.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Called of God an high Prieſt,</hi>] Chriſt
becomes the author or cauſe of eternall ſalvation by this meanes, in being
ordained an high Prieſt of God; for when God calls him an high Prieſt,
thereby hee makes him ſo. <hi>After the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi>]
Chriſt is ſuch a high Prieſt unto us, that withall he is alſo our
heavenly Lord and King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſupreme power to pardon all our ſinnes and
to free us from the puniſhment of them. But of this point we ſhall ſpeake
more largely, chap 7.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Of whom we have many things to ſay,</hi>] Hee
paſſeth to another point, wherein he reproves the ſlowneſſe and
dulneſſe of them to whom he writes; to this end, that he may excite and
prepare them to receive thoſe myſteries which he had in his minde to open
concerning the Prieſthood of Chriſt. <hi>Of whom, i.</hi> of Chriſt our
high Prieſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reference to his Prieſthood abſolutely, or
reſpectively as it is compared with the Prieſthood of Melchiſedeck.
<hi>We have many things to ſay,</hi>] We have in our minde plentifull and
copious matter, which we would expreſſe concerning his Prieſthood.
<hi>And hard to be uttered,</hi>] Not hard to the Author to utter ſimply, but
hard for him to utter ſo plainly, that they might eaſily bee apprehended
and underſtood of them to whom he ſhould utter them. And this hardneſſe
proceeded partly from the greatneſſe and ſublimeneſſe of the matters
to bee utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and partly from the incapacity and dulneſſe of them to
whom they ſhould be uttered. <hi>Seeing yee are dull of hearing.</hi>]
<hi>q.d.</hi> The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of uttering theſe things, is not ſo much in
regard of the things themſelves, or in regard of mee, to whom the things are
ſufficiently knowne, as in regard of you, by reaſon of your dulneſſe.
For if yee were of a ready and quicke capacity, it were eaſie for me to utter
all, and for you to conceive them. Dull is he, that doth not eaſily heare, or
attend, or not apprehend and conſider things uttered unto him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the holy myſteries of ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>For when for the time ye ought to be
teachers,</hi>] Their dulneſſe of hearing holy myſteries is here declared
from the effect of it, namely that they were yet unskilfull and rude in the
firſt principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, when notwithſtanding they had
ſpent ſo much time in the Schoole of Chriſt, that they were not only
competently to know the Chriſtian Religion themſelves, but alſo ought to
teach it unto others; which was a great argument and ſign of their
ſlowneſſe and dulneſſe. <hi>Ye have need that one teach you againe,
which be the firſt principles of the oracles of God,</hi>] For a man to be
taught, is not ſtrange, neither doth it argue idleneſſe or dulneſſe;
but to be taught over againe and anew, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61860:47"/>the
firſt principles and elements, this is a ſigne of a heavy and dull
ſpirit. There is an elegant oppoſition between him that ſhould teach, and
him that needs teaching, eſpecially the elements of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and
the firſt elements of all. The principles of any diſcipline, are thoſe
verities, which have no reaſons, and cannot be proved, but are the reaſons
or cauſes to prove other verities; and therefore are learned in the firſt
place, becauſe they are knowne of themſelves without the knowledge of other
verities: but other verities cannot be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of them.
Theſe of ſome Divines are called funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, in alluſion to the
foundations of buildings; becauſe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are firſt laid, and can
lye without the buildings, but the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings cannot be made without them; for
the buildings are ſupported by the foundations, and not the foundations by
the buildings. <hi>The oracles of God.</hi>] All the verities of Chriſtian
Religion, whether they be principles that prove, or doctrines that are proved
from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the oracles of God; becauſe they are the words of
God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his mouth, and revealed unto men by his holy Spirit.
<hi>And are become ſuch as have need of milke, and not of ſtrong
meat.</hi>] This is but a circumlocution of their ignorance and
childiſhneſſe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian verities. Yee are become ſuch, that ye
have need of principles which are the moſt ſimple verities and eaſieſt
to bee underſtood, as knowne of themſelves; and not of abſtruce and
recondite doctrines, the truths whereof appeare not, but by the meanes and
trace of many principles, and foreknowne doctrines; the apprehenſion whereof
doth agitate and labour both the underſtanding and memory. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of
Chriſtianity are reſembled unto milke, becauſe as milke is a
nouriſhment moſt eaſie of digeſtion and concoction, becauſe it hath a
neare affinity with bloud wherewith we are finally nouriſhed, for milke is
but elaborate bloud: ſo the principles of Religion are moſt eaſily
apprehended and underſtood; becauſe they have a neare affinity with the
Spirit, whereby wee are finally ſaved, for the principles are ſpirit and
life. And abſtruce doctrines are reſembled to ſtrong meat; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſtrong meat is hardly digeſted, and therefore is not nouriſhment for all
ſtomackes: ſo abſtruce doctrines are hardly underſtood, and therefore
are not verities for every capacity: And as ſtrong meat not digeſted breeds
crudities and diſeaſes in the body: ſo abſtruce do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines not
underſtood, breed controverſies and diſtractions in the Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>For every one that uſeth milke,</hi>] He had
tacitly affirmed before that ſtrong meat muſt not be given to them that
need milke; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that abſtruce doctrines muſt not be propoſed to
novices and weake mindes. This aſſertion he proves by this reaſon,
becauſe he that uſeth milke is unskilfull in the word of
righteouſneſſe; and he confirmes this reaſon by another proofe,
becauſe he that uſeth milke is a babe. Seeing <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61860:48"/>therefore
a babe is unskilfull in the word of righteouſneſſe; therefore alſo he
that uſeth milke muſt needs be unskifull in the ſame. <hi>He that uſeth
milke,</hi>] is not meant by him that eateth milke and other meats alſo; for
ſo doe many perſons of full growth; but by him that eateth only milke, and
can receive no other nouriſhment. Unskilfull is hee that hath yet made no
triall, nor entrance into the principles of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcipline; for ſuch a one
is altogether unskilfull. <hi>The word of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi>] is an
Hebraiſme for the right word; that is for the true and perfect word, that is
right and fit for them to know; for true right and perfect are either the
ſame, or equipollent, or adequate; as mutuall conſequents one to another,
and concurrent properties to the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Hence in Scripture they are
often confounded or ſubſtituted one for another. So David Pſalme 4 1.
calleth God, the God of his righteouſneſſe; <hi>i.</hi> his true right
and perfect God, in oppoſition to the heatheniſh gods, their idols and
images, which were not true and right gods, but falſe and wrong gods. So our
Saviour, Luke 16.11. oppoſeth the riches of unrighteouſneſſe to the
true, right and perfect riches. He therefore that yet uſeth milke only, hath
not yet attained to the true right and perfect word of God for a ſolid
knowledge of Chriſt, nor hath ever made triall of taſting and digeſting
it in his minde, and therefore is not capable of it, but his minde would
inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be oppreſſed with it. For a man muſt firſt make triall of
his ſtength, and the minde by ſmall exerciſes muſt be prepared for
greater matters; as infants and babes, as long as they ſucke milke only, and
by little and little uſe no ſolid meats, are all that while incapable of
them. The words of the Author are a contracted ſimilitude, or a tranſition
from the ſimily to the matter it ſelfe; for the ſubject of his
aſſertion ſhews in part the propoſition of the ſimily, and the
predicat makes the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it. As among other places, we have the like
contracted ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, Luke 9.62. For the ſimily explicated muſt runne thus:
As hee that yet hath uſed only milke, is uncapable of ſolid meat; ſo hee
that is yet in the principles of Chriſtianity is unskilfull of the
myſteries and right doctrines of it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>But ſtrong meat belongeth to them that are
(perfect) of full age.</hi>] Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid that ſtrong meat muſt not be
given to babes; now on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he ſhewes to whom it muſt be given;
namely, to them that are adulted or perfect in age. For the perfect or adulted
who are of age, are here oppoſed to infants and babes; and ſo they are
oppoſed, 1. Cor. 14.20. and Epheſ. 4.13.14. <hi>Even thoſe, who by
reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed,</hi>] Thoſe, is not any
note of diſtinction, to difference ſome perfect or adulted perſons from
others: but a note of explication, to ſhew the cauſe of his aſſertion.
For the Author ſhews the cauſe or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why onely ſtrong meat is to
be given to the perfect, or them of full age, and to them only. The reaſon
is, becauſe they only have their <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61860:48"/>ſenſories, or organs
of their ſences exerciſed, as their eyes, tongue, and palate, whereby they
can eaſily diſcerne and judge of ſtrong meat, which is good and
wholſome for them, and contrarily, which is evil and hurtfull. Theſe
ſenſories of their eyes, tongue, and palate, they have exerciſed through
practiſe and cuſtome, in ſeeing, touching, and taſting of meates.
<hi>To diſcerne both good and evil.</hi>] Theſe words are not to be taken
in a Morall ſenſe, but a Phyſicall. He that is of perfect or full age,
and hath been accuſtome to make ſeverall trials of ſeverall meats, can
eaſily finde by experience what meats doe agree with his ſtomack, and what
not; for they that are agreeing and nouriſhing to him, they are good and
wholſome for him; they which doe not, are evil and hurtfull. Which difference
of meats being firſt tryed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his ſtomack, hee will afterward
eaſily diſcerne by his outward ſences, and particularly by his eye; which
upon ſight of any meats will eaſily judge of them before hee taſte them.
To theſe perfect or full aged perſons, they are reſembled, who have their
mindes exerciſed and trained, with frequent and daily meditations of things
divine, who have taſted divers doctrines, as it were ſeverall meats, and
have digeſted the knowledge of many divine myſteries; who have gotten a
cuſtome or habite of minde, whereby they can eaſily diſcerne and judge,
what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is true and what falſe, which is conſequent to Chriſtian
religion, and which is repugnant. This diſcretion they onely have attained,
who can comprehend in their minde as it were a body of Chriſtian religion,
and ſtick not onely in the firſt principles of it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Herefore leaving the Principles of the Doctrine
of Chriſt</hi>] There is a double ſence of theſe words found among
Interpreters, and thereupon a double way of their coherence with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter. For it is plaine that the words are inferd from thence, as the
particle <hi>therefore</hi> ſhewes: Both ſences of the words ſeeme to
re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire, that they be taken in a Rhetoricall communication: but in a contrary
manner. For either the Authour ſpeakes perſonally here of himſelfe, and
ſaith, that himſelfe in this place, will leave the princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples of the
Doctrine of Chriſt, and proceed to explicate more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Myſteries
comprehended therein: or elſe hee admoniſheth them to whom hee writes, that
they leaving thoſe Principles, would proceed to a fuller knowledge in
Chriſtianitie. We ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approve of the former ſence, as followed by many
learned men; yet becauſe the latter is not to be deſpiſed, therefore we
ſhall explicate them both. If therefore we receive the firſt ſence, the
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſeemes to ſay; Therefore I will leave to ſpeake further of the
principles of Chriſtianity, and draw toward the perfection of it, and
propoſe deeper myſteries in it; for I will not lay againe the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Repentance to be practiſed, and of Faith to relye on God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I
deliver the doctrine of Baptiſmes, of Impoſition of hands, of the
Reſurrection of the dead, and of eternall life: Upon which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as upon
principles and foundations, the doctrines of Repentance and faith in God is
raiſed and built up. Theſe principles I will not handle againe, for it is
enough that they have beene propounded once; although I refuſe not to handle
them againe, if God permit. Which I therefore ſpeake, becauſe it is
impoſſible for thoſe who were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, &amp;c. to renew them
againe unto repentance. If we follow this ſence, all points will agree well
enough: yet in the coherence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there will ſeeme ſome difficulty. For
ſome man may object; Seeing the Author ſaid in the former chapter, that
thoſe Hebrewes had need <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61860:49"/>to be taught againe the very
principles of Religion, to be nouriſhed with milke, and not with meate; How
can he from this inferre, that therefore he will leave the principles, and the
milke, to propoſe ſtrong meate and deeper myſteries, ſeeing rather he
ſhould inferre the quite contrary? This difficulty may eaſily be ſalved,
if we ſay that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of theſe words muſt be referred to the
eleventh verſe of the former chapter, where the Author ſaid, He had many
things to ſay and hard to be uttered of Chriſt his high Prieſthood; That
in reference to theſe words, he might inferre, Therefore leaving the
principles, let us go on to perfection. So that all the intermediate verſes
betweene the eleventh of the former chapter, and the beginning of this, which
were added occaſionally, to excite the Hebrewes to a diligent attention,
muſt be read as it were in a parentheſis. If then we follow this ſence,
we muſt ſay, that the Author in the firſt part of this chapter doth
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that he will proceed in explicating the myſteries of Chriſts
Prieſthood, notwithſtanding the Hebrewes by reaſon of their
ſlow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and dulneſſe, were not very capable of them; and that he
would not now ſpend any labour in delivering the principles of Chriſtian
Religion. Thus of the former ſence, now for the latter. The Author had
reproved the Hebrewes, for being ſo ſlow and dull in their ſtudy of
Chriſtianity, that when for the length of their time ſpent therein, they
ſhould become teachers of others, themſelves had need to be taught againe
the firſt principles of it; and like babes, muſt yet be nouriſhed with
milke, and not with ſtrong meate; Therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them, that
caſting off this drowſineſſe of ſpirit, they would leave at laſt
thoſe principles, and launch themſelves into a deeper knowledge of thoſe
divine myſteries. Therefore, that which before he had objected unto them,
that they had need to be taught againe the principles of Chriſtianity, muſt
not be ſo underſtood as if they had now wholly forgotten or loſt them;
for this, to ſpeake generally of them all, could hardly be; but becauſe by
their negligence, they did not well remember them, but had need to have them
renewed, and re-inforced upon them. For, it plainly appeares from paſſages
which are read of them, both in this chapter, and other parts of this
Epiſtle, that they began to doubt of the Chriſtian faith and truth. Now
they that are ſuch, have need that Chriſtian principles ſhould be anew
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated and confirmed unto them. Neither is it his meaning, that they
ſhould altogether leave and neglect the principles, and ſo goe on to
perfection, for this neither could nor muſt be done; but they ſhould not
ſtick and dwell wholly upon the principles, without proceeding any further;
for they that proceed further, doe paſſe by the places whereat they are
already arrived. So a man may ſay to a boy, leave your Accedence and your
Grammer, and paſſe on to other Authors. <hi>The principles of the doctrine
of Chriſt</hi>] They are the fundamentall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61860:50"/>which being firſt learned, do help us to proceed in Chriſtian
Religion. <hi>Let us go on unto perfection</hi>] The principles rightly
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and applyed, will by degrees carry us on from one verity to
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we come at the deepeſt myſteries of Chriſtianity, and into
a full body; where being once arrived, we are at perfection, even at a
fulneſſe and ripeneſſe in the knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Not laying
againe the foundation</hi>] The foundation is the firſt principles of
Chriſtianity, which are as it were a foundation of that edifice of doctrines,
wherein the perfect knowledge of God and Chriſt conſiſteth. Now to
<hi>lay</hi> this foundation, is either to teach theſe principles, if we
follow the former ſenſe, or to learne them, if we follow the latter. And to
lay this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <hi>againe</hi>] is to initiate theſe principles anew
from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and for a man to become the Diſciple of Chriſt a
ſecond time, after once he had deſerted the verities of them; whereof
(ſuppoſing the latter ſenſe) he would have the Hebrewes to beware; for
they were neere approaching to this miſchiefe, and leſt they ſhould fall
into it, the Author excites them very ſeriouſly. For they had not as yet
altogether deſerted the Chriſtian faith, as appeares partly from this whole
Epiſtle, and partly from a paſſage at the ninth verſe of this chapter,
where he ſaith, that he is perſwaded better things of them, then of thoſe
(he meanes) who after the knowledge of the truth, have relapſed and revolted
from it; and laſtly, in that he continues to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to conſtancy in
Chriſtianity. <hi>Of repentance from dead workes</hi>] He being to explicate
this foundation of Chriſtianity, and layes ſeverall parts of it, whereof
the firſt is repentance. But becauſe in this place (as we have ſaid) he
treates of laying the foundation not in regard of Chriſtian life, but of
Chriſtian doctrine; as it appeares by the words following, of reſurrection
of the dead, and eternall life, which may be repeated againe in reſpect of
the doctrine or learning of them: Therefore here to lay the foundation of
repentance, is either to teach or learne the doctrine of repentance; and in
like manner the doctrine of faith in God, of the reſurrection of the dead,
and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall judgement. All which doctrines are the principles of
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an diſcipline, and as it were the foundation of all other
Chriſtian veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Dead workes, are deadly workes, ſuch as bring and
continue death upon the agent. And repentance from theſe deadly workes which
is a principle of Chriſtianity, includes not onely a ſorrow of minde, that
thou haſt committed deadly workes, but alſo and much rather, the effect of
that ſorrow, which is a courſe of minde and life far diverſe from the
former. For repentance is ſometimes diſtinguiſhed from that ſorrow as
the effect from the cauſe. See 2 Cor. 7.9,10. <hi>And of faith towards
God.</hi>] What that is, the Author ſhews afterward chap. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the doctrine of baptiſmes, and the laying on
of hands,</hi>] Theſe <pb n="95" facs="tcp:61860:50"/>words may be taken two wayes,
either as they ſignifie ſome part of the foundation, diſtinct from the
parts, both preceding and following, namely from the doctrine of repentance and
faith, of the reſurrection and eternall judgement; or elſe as added by way
of appoſition for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification ſake. <hi>q.d.</hi> which doctrines of
repentance and faith, belong to thoſe that are baptized, and that receive
Impoſition of hands. If we follow the former ſenſe, and take them for
parts of the foundation, to ſignifie the doctrine of Baptiſmes, and of
Impoſition of hands; then firſt it may be demanded, what that doctrine is?
The Anſwer is, that doctrine conſiſteth chiefly in ſhewing, what
baptiſmes and impoſition of hands ſignifie, and to what ends they are
uſed. And theſe doctrines are therefore accounted among the principles of
Chriſtianity, becauſe they were uſed from the beginning of the Church to
initiate men into Chriſt, and therefore it was needfull that the Diſciples
of Chriſt, ſhould at firſt be inſtructed in them, and be taught their
end and ſcope. Secondly, it may be demanded, why he mentions baptiſmes in
the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, as if he intended many, (although the Syriake
tranſlation render it <hi>baptiſme</hi> in the ſingular number) ſeeing
Chriſtians received but one baptiſme of water for repentance.
<hi>Reſp.</hi> This was therefore done, either becauſe he ſpake in
reſpect of them that were baptiſed, who becauſe they were many, made
alſo many baptiſmes; or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he reſpected both the
baptiſme of John, who was the forerunner of Chriſt, and the baptiſme of
the Apoſtles the followers of Chriſt, eſpecially that wherewith the
Apoſtles baptiſed after the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt.
For the Baptiſme of John was the baptiſme of Repentance for the
remiſſion of ſinnes, which was uſed as a ſigne and a pledge of future
repentance for the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by waſhing it
reſembled repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes. For both theſe are a
waſhing from the filth of ſin; repentance is a waſhing from the acts of
it, and remiſſion from the guilt and paine of it. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was
ſignified as the baptiſme of thoſe that were baptiſed of their owne
accord was an action. Remiſſion was ſignified, as the action of John
himſelfe, who in a manner repreſented the perſon of God, as his legat or
meſſenger, and in the name of God did promiſe men the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and
purgation of their ſinnes, and declared this by the ſigne of waſhing. But
the Baptiſme of Chriſt, doth not only repreſent repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and
remiſſion of ſinnes, or is not only received as a ſigne of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
repentance and remiſſion; but over and above it is a ſigne of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on
Chriſt; and with him, of dying to ſinne and riſing to newneſſe of
life, that at laſt with him alſo wee may attaine everlaſting life; for
baptiſme doth elegantly ſhadow out our death and buriall with Chriſt by
our immerſion into the water, and our reſurrection with him by our
emerſion out of the water. This Paul hath taught us, in ſome paſſages
of his Epiſtles. See Rom. 6.3,4. and Col. 2.12. <hi>And of laying on of 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61860:51"/>hands,</hi>] Some by this underſtand, that Impoſition
of hands, which was in uſe anciently in the Chriſtian Church, whereby the
Elders laid their hands upon ſuch as were admitted to the communion and
ſociety of the faithfull; which uſe as it ſeems was derived or drawne
from the Apoſtles, who were wont to lay their hands upon ſuch as were to
receive the Holy Ghoſt. But if we follow the former ſenſe of theſe
words as we have already explicated them, it is better to take them for that
Impoſition of hands which the Apoſtles uſed for this end, that the
Diſciples of Chriſt might receive the Holy Ghoſt. See Acts 8.17,18,19.
and 2 Tim. 1.6. Yet the ſenſe will be no leſſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, if wee take
the words the latter way, to ſignifie the doctrine which belonged to thoſe
that are baptiſed, and have hands laid on them. As if the Author had ſaid,
Let us not returne to learne the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of repentance and faith in God,
which uſeth to be propoſed to them that are baptiſed and have hands laid
on them. For wee were long ſince baptiſed and had hands laid on us. Let us
leave theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to novices, and to ſuch as come newly to the
diſcipline of Chriſt. This ſenſe hath pleaſed ſome learned men; and
if we admit it, we muſt read the words as it were in a Parentheſis. And
<hi>of reſurrection of the dead,</hi>] The two remaining points are
fundamentall: And by the reſurrection of the dead in this place and many
others, hee ſeems to comprehend immortall life, as the reward which the godly
attaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. <hi>And of eternall judgement.</hi>] Which is the
puniſhment or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the ungodly. For ſeeing in this place the word
judgement may ſignifie two things, either the ſentence or decree in
generall tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching men; or damnation and puniſhment in particular: the latter
of theſe is more conſonant to reaſon, becauſe of the word eternall
attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to judgement. For this is more proper and uſually called
eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment, then the paſſing of the ſentence, which in it
ſelfe is not eternall, though in the effect of it, it be eternall. If
therefore eternall judgement ſignifie eternall puniſhment, then the
reſurrection of the dead in this place muſt ſignifie an eternall reward,
<hi>i.</hi> a bleſſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life; which alſo a Popiſh
Interpreter upon this place hath obſerved, by ſaying: 
<q rend="inline">"Among other things, theſe two were
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally delivered to the catechiſed, the doctrine of the reſurrection
of the dead, and of eternall judgement, that by hope of the reſurrection they
might willingly expoſe themſelves unto all dangers for Chriſt, and for
feare of the judgement never returne to their former ſins."</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And this will we do, if God permit,</hi>]
<hi>i.</hi> If God permit, wee will lay the foundation againe. As if he had
ſaid, Although by all meanes we ſhould take heed, that the matter fall not
to this paſſe, as to caſt a neceſſity upon us to lay the foundation
againe; Yet we will doe ſo, if God ſhall pleaſe to permit us; whereby he
tacitly intimates, that God would not alwayes ſuffer this to be done: yet the
Authors words are <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61860:51"/>ſo carried, that as he did not
altogether hope it, ſo neither did he wholly deſpaire it. For, in the words
following, he ſeemes to reſpect both theſe caſes; the former of them in
the next words, ver. 4. and the latter at the ninth verſe, where he is
perſwaded better things of them, and things that accompany ſalvation; of
which his perſwaſion or hope, he alledgeth a reaſon drawne from the
righteouſneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For it is impoſsible for thoſe who were once
enlightned</hi>] In theſe words the Author brings a reaſon, partly of what
he lately intimated, touching Gods permiſſion, and partly of what he had
openly ſaid, of not laying againe the foundation; namely, becauſe it is
impoſſible that effect ſhould follow, which hereby may be intended.
Beſides, as we noted before, it appeares, that the Author ſpeakes here
properly of Apoſtates, who condemne Chriſtian Religion as falſe, and
thereupon deſert it. Of theſe he ſaith, <hi>It is impoſsible for them
to be renewed unto repentance</hi>] Which impoſſibility partly depends upon
the naturall difficulty, that ſuch ſhould be againe converted unto
Chriſt, who have once forſaken him; for, it is an eaſier labour to
retaine the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion being once attained, then to recover it being
once loſt; but if thoſe men have not performed the eaſier worke in
retaining it, much leſſe will they performe the harder in recovering it.
And if Chriſtianity could not ſo work upon them, as not to reject it, how
ſhall it gaine upon them to re-embrace it, and receive it for true, when it
ſtands rejected? And the impoſſibility partly depends upon Gods will and
decree; who, when men become ſo ungracious, as to ſtaine their ſoules
with ſuch an incredible wickedneſſe, is wont to judge them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of
his grace, and thereupon to reprobate and curſe them, (which word the Author
uſeth afterward at the eighth verſe, by a ſimily drawne from a barren
ſoile.) Whence it comes to paſſe, that (as the Scripture ſpeakes) God
hardens them, and holds them captives to his judgements. Which
notwithſtanding muſt not be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if God would never
releaſe this juſt rigour and ſeverity, but onely that he uſeth not to
releaſe it. For the Civilians ſay. <hi>That which depends upon the
pleaſure of the Prince, is deemed impoſsible</hi>] i. That which by the
common courſe of Law cannot be done, unleſſe the Prince grant it by
vertue of his prerogative, is not thought poſſible and ſeaſable,
eſpecially if the thing be ſuch as the Prince uſeth not to grant.
Renovation therefore is impoſſible, unleſſe God as it were make uſe
of his prerogative to extend his ſingular grace and favour toward ſuch a
man, not onely not to harden him, and oppoſe himſelfe againſt his
converſion, but alſo to further him by his ſpeciall aſſiſtance, and
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with moſt effectuall remedies for his reclaiming. For,
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſaying of Jeremy muſt ſtand good, <hi>Can the Ethiopian
change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots, then may yee alſo do good, that
are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61860:52"/>to do evill.</hi> The man accuſtomed to
evill cannot ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from his evill cuſtome; but if he do, the
caſe is extraordinary, by an extraordinary influence of Gods grace upon him.
<hi>Who were once enlightned.</hi>] He begins to deſcribe thoſe men, that
have beene converted unto Chriſt; In which deſcription he declares what
graces ſuch men have received from God. Whence it is no mervaile, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their neglect and contempt of ſo great graces, God do afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
and reject them. Men converted are enlightned with the light of the Goſpel,
wherewith (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) Chriſt hath brought life and
immortality to light, 2 Tim. 1.10. whereby he hath expeld all errors, all
darkneſſe and blindneſſe of minde. <hi>And have taſted of the
heavenly gift</hi>] The article <hi>the</hi> added to gift, doth deſigne and
ſpecifie ſome extraordinary and notable gift. Yet he meanes not the gift of
the holy Ghoſt, becauſe he mentions that particularly by it ſelfe
preſently after. And therefore he rather meanes, that which ariſeth and
followeth in the minde after it is enlightned with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; ſuch as is
the tranquility and peace of minde, which growes from the knowledge of a
plenary pardon of all our ſins; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing joy which iſſues from
the hope of eternall life. For theſe are truly heavenly gifts, which men
converted unto Chriſt have taſted, by feeling the pleaſantneſſe and
ſweetneſſe of them in their ſoules. <hi>And were made partakers of the
holy Ghoſt</hi>] Men converted unto Chriſt, are made partakers of that
divine power and efficacy, whereby their minds are yet more cleerely and
certainly enlightned; whereby thoſe heavenly gifts are enlarged and
increaſed unto them for the greater beauty, ornament, and comfort of their
ſoules; whereby they are ſealed unto the day of redemption, whereby they
receive an earneſt, a pledge, and an aſſurance of their heavenly
inheritance; and whereby they perceive the certaine truth of their Chriſtian
faith, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures ſuch great benefits from God unto them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And have taſted the good word of God</hi>] The
good word of God, although it may ſignifie the whole doctrine of the
Goſpel, which is very faire and good; every way conſonant to reaſon and
honeſty: yet by uſe of Scripture, it ſeemes to ſignifie particularly
that part of Gods word, which containes Gods promiſes; becauſe when God
makes us a promiſe, he therein gives us his word; And as Gods other revealed
verities are his true word, ſo his promiſes are his good word; becauſe
they alwayes entitle us to ſome good which is conveyed in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. So
Gods promiſe to the Jews for the releaſe of their Captivity, is called his
good word, and his performance of that promiſe is called the performance of
his good word; becauſe both the promiſe, and eſpecially the performance
of it brought a great good to the people of God. Thus ſaith the Lord, that
after ſeventy yeares be accompliſhed at Babylon, I will viſit you, and
performe my <hi>good word</hi> toward you <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61860:52"/>in cauſing you
to returne to this place, Jer. 29.10. This promiſe or good word was given
unto them before, as ye may reade, Jer. 25.12. And ſo Gods promiſe of
Chriſt, in raiſing a Branch of righteouſneſſe unto David, was his
good word; and the performance of it is called a performance of that good thing
which he promiſed, See Jer. 33.14,15. <hi>And the powers of the world to
come.</hi>] Theſe powers ſeeme to be thoſe eminent qualities of that
world and life to come; ſuch as are everlaſting pleaſure, glory, beauty,
dignity, ſtrength, and force; a totall freedome from all evill, and a totall
fulneſſe of all good: Of theſe powers or qualities, men converted unto
Chriſt have taſted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not onely enlightned with the
knowledge of them, and delighted with the hope of them, but alſo affected
with an unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſe of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If they fall away</hi>] Wee have noted before, that
the Authour treats not here of a ſimple falling into ſin: but of a falling
away which is Apoſtacy, whereof he before alſo made mention, chap. 3.13.
This may be proved from 2. grounds. 1. Becauſe God doth not uſe to
reprobate men converted unto Chriſt, and put in that ſtate which the
Authour formerly deſcribed, if after their converſion adhering ſtill to
the Chriſtian religion, if they fall ſimply into whatſoever ſin. For
the Apoſtle ſaith. If any man ſinne (any man that hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to Chriſt) we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſu; Chriſt the righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eous. 1 John 2.1. From theſe words it
is plaine, that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto Chriſt, ſhall obtaine pardon of God,
even of thoſe ſinnes which they have committed after their converſion, in
caſe they forſake them, and wholly caſt off the yoke of ſinne, and
follow Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For if they were not pardoned for ſuch lapſes,
then Chriſt were not their advocare. 2. The Author ſpeaks here of ſuch as
crucifie the Son of God againe, and put him to an open ſhame, as appears in
this verſe. But this can agree to none but Apoſtates, as we ſhall ſee
in the explication of thoſe words. Yet there are ſome ſinnes, which by
way of analogie may be reduced to Apoſtacie; as thoſe that are committed
preſumptuouſly with a high hand, after knowledge of the truth, <hi>i.</hi>
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away all feare and reverence of God. For hee that yet retaines and
embraceth the doctrine of Chriſt in his minde, cannot let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo
looſe unto ſinne; Or if a man after the knowledge of the truth, and
reception of the Chriſtian faith, have no ſerious thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and amendment of life, but indulge himſelfe to ſinne as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as
looſely as he did before; Or having caſt off the yoke of ſin, doe againe
deliver up himſelfe to the ſervitude and bondage of ſinne; The
miſerable and dolefull condition of ſuch men is deſcribed by Peter, 2
Pet. 2. For ſuch men ſeem little to regard the holineſſe of Chriſtian
Religion, which they had embraced; and therefore come not much ſhort of them,
who altogether reject it. But he that in hope <pb n="100" facs="tcp:61860:53"/>of retaining
the reward promiſed by Chriſt, doth alwayes carry a minde to forſake
ſinne, and ſeriouſly endeavours it, though for ſome time he caſt not
away the cuſtome of ſome vice, or make himſelfe guilty of ſome heynous
ſinne through infirmity, is not therefore ſo wholly reprobated and
accurſed, that it ſhould prove impoſſible for him to be recovered from
ſuch ſinnes, and after recovery to be juſtified and ſaved. <hi>To renew
them againe unto repentance,</hi>] To renew is a verb of active
ſignification, and notes the act of another upon one ſo fallen away. From
whence it appeares, in his former words verſe 1. where he ſaid, <hi>not
laying againe the foundation, &amp;c.</hi> and at the 3. verſe, <hi>and this
will we doe,</hi> doth really ſpeake either of himſelfe alone, or at
leaſt as including himſelfe as the renewer of ſuch. For in theſe words
hee ſhewes the cauſe of thoſe, <hi>q.d.</hi> Take heed, that we be not
forced to renew you againe to repentance; becauſe it is impoſſible to
renew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to repentance thoſe that have once beene Chriſtians, and have
ceaſed to be ſo. <hi>Vnto repentance,</hi>] So as they performe the acts of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by changing their minde into a better frame, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
their former reſolution to reſume that Religion again, which once they have
wickedly rejected, and then to compoſe their life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of
it. <hi>Seeing they crucifie to themſelves the Sonne of God afreſh,</hi>]
In theſe words hee ſhewes the matter wherein this falling away
conſiſts, or rather the foul wickedneſſe cleaving to it, and therefore
what good cauſe there is, why God wil not have ſuch perſons renewed to
repentance. To crucifie the Son of God is a damnable wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; how much
more is it ſo, to crucifie him afreſh, after he is now become glorious,
immortall, and Lord of all things? <hi>To themſelves,</hi>] They doe not
crucifie him afreſh really and properly, for that cannot be, but to
themſelves. In reſpect of themſelves they doe it; for their falling away
from the Chriſtian Religion, is all one as if they crucified Chriſt; for by
their falling away, they judge and condemne him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to have been a
ſeducer, a teacher of falſe doctrines, and ſo to have been deſervedly
crucified. <hi>And put him to an open ſhame,</hi>] They caſt a publike
ignominy and reproach upon him, as is done to thoſe who undergo a publike and
infamous puniſhment. This very wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Author expreſſeth in
other words, ſignifying the ſame thing, chap. 10.29. where he ſaith,
<hi>They tread under foot the Sonne, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the bloud of the Covenant an
unholy thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>For the earth,</hi>] He illuſtrates and withall
confirmes his former aſſertion by an argument partly of ſimilitude and
partly of contrariety. For while he ſhews what is done to good men that are
fruitfull of good workes, he ſhews withall what befalls men forgetfull of
Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits conferred upon them, and ungratefull to him. This ſimily hee
propoſeth in a conciſe and contracted forme of ſpeech, confounding and
mingling the members of it, as is frequently done both in Sacred 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61860:53"/>and prophane Writers. For hereupon he ſeems to ſay of
the earth, that becauſe it is fruitfull, therefore it receives bleſſing
from God; which cannot be ſaid properly but only by way of compatiſon. For
God doth not bleſſe the earth with fruits as a reward of her
fruitfulneſſe; for the bleſſing of God upon the earth is the inriching
her with fruits; as appears by the words of Iſaac to Jacob, Gen. 27.27.
<hi>See the ſmell of my ſonne, is as the ſmell of a field, which the Lord
hath bleſſed.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a fruitfull ſoile is tilled the more
diligently; hence it is that it more plentifully abounds in fruits. And, as we
have noted, the Author ſpake in this manner, becauſe in the reddition this
ſimily it is properly true. For when a man becomes like a fruitfull ſoile
and abounds in the fruits of good workes, then he receives ableſſing from
God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his godlineſſe. <hi>Which drinketh in the raine that
often commeth upon it,</hi>] The raine that often moiſteneth the earth, is
like the gifts of God ſhowred downe upon men, whereof he treated, ver. 4.5.
which are therefore fitly reſembled to the raine often falling on the earth,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are manifold and plenteous, ſufficient to moiſten the
ſoul of man, and make it ſpiritually fertill to produce divers fruits of
good workes. The raine may alſo reſemble the frequent and daily preaching
of Gods word; which when it is preached, is like a ſhowre ſtreaming downe
from heaven to water and fructifie the ſoule of man. But the former
reſemblance is more full and more fit to the point. <hi>And brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth
hearbs meet for them for whom it is dreſſed.</hi>] The various fruits of
vertue, and workes acceptable to God, done according to his Laws, doe
reſemble thoſe hearbs which the earth brings forth, meet for them that
dreſſe it; or rather meet for them, at whoſe charge and for whoſe
ſake it is dreſſed, namely for the Lord of the ſoile, to whom the
fruits and revenues of it doe belong and accrue; who in the reddition of the
ſimily, is God. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are Gods labourers; ye
are Gods tillage, yee are Gods building,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. <hi>Is
dreſſed,</hi>] The earth, beſides the falling of raine upon it, muſt
have a diligent tilling or dreſſing. For the raine alone is not
ſufficient to make the earth fruitfull in hearbs meet for the Owner of it,
unleſſe it be alſo dreſſed by plowing or digging, weeding and
dunging. Hence the vine-dreſſer pleaded for the barren fig-tree, <hi>Lord
let it alone this yeere alſo, till I ſhall dig about it and dung it,</hi>
Luke 13.8. So alſo God doth not onely water our ſoules with his gifts, as
with frequent and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhowres, but alſo affords us a diligent
and various dreſſing, by the labour of his Miniſters, to inſtruct,
exhort, reprove and comfort us. <hi>Receaveth bleſsing from God</hi>] Why the
Authour ſpeakes thus of the earth, and what that bleſſing is in reference
to the earth, we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already in the enterance of this verſe. But
in reference to men fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good workes, this bleſſing of God
ſignifies, both a multiplying of his ſpirituall gifts in this life (for to
him that hath ſhall bee given, <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61860:54"/>ſaith Chriſt, and
every branch that beareth fruit, God prunes it, that it may bring forth more
fruit, John 15.2.) and alſo chiefly the gift of eternall happineſſe in
the life to come. For then God bleſſeth a man when he makes things to goe
well with him; but better things can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go with us, then when he makes us
eternally bleſſed and happy.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>But that which beareth thornes and briars.</hi>]
That earth which is watered with frequent rain, and diligently dreſſed,
doth not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beare thornes and briars. Whence it appeares, that
here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath reference to men, who have received the knowledge of
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, as the aſſertion it ſelfe requires: for proofe whereof, he
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth theſe words; and to ſuch men who for no ſmall time have been
endowed with divers gifts, and diligently dreſſed of God. Theſe thornes
and briars are all ſorts of evill workes, which have no uſe, but for evil;
for hence the Apoſtle calls them unfruitfull workes, Epheſ. 5.11. Among
which, Apoſtaſie or defection from Chriſt, leads the firſt ranke. And
from this ſimily it is manifeſt, that the judgement or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which
expects apoſtates, doth alſo wait for them, who have affinity with
apoſtates (whom we mentioned before) who after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and
after ſo many gifts and benefits beſtowed by God upon them, are yet
indulgent to their ſinnes, and without all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of a better life
conformable to Gods lawes. <hi>Is rejected,</hi>] In the originall, is
reprobated: For no man is willing to labour in vain, and to weary himſelfe
with fruitleſſe workes. When a piece of land hath been dreſſed and
dunged with all labour and care, and yet in ſtead of fruits, bringeth forth
nothing but thorns and briars, and other weeds, that yeeld no profit to the
husbandman; the manner is for men to meddle no more with ſuch a piece of
land, but to reject and leave it. That which the husbandman doth to an evil
ground, the ſame doth God to men that reſemble evil ground; for God will
beſtow no more labour and care upon them, but will reprobate, reject and
leave them. <hi>And is nigh unto curſing.</hi>] The husbandman can hardly
forbear from curſing ſuch an evil piece of ground; for it cannot be farre
from a curſe. So ſuch men as are like evil ground, are not far from the
curſe of God, but are like the barren fig-tree which Chriſt curſed, when
he found no fruit upon it; <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for
ever,</hi> Matth. 21.19. If this curſe fall upon fruitleſſe men, then
there remaines no hope of repentance and amendment. But the Author would rather
ſay, that ſuch ground is <hi>nigh unto curſing,</hi> then already
curſed. For though fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men deſerve Gods preſent curſe, yet
God doth not preſently lay his curſe upon them, but for a long time delayes
their puniſhment, and expects fruits of repentance; as in the parable of the
barren fig-tree, the Lord of it ſtayed three yeares without any fruit of it,
and yet forbare it a fourth yeare at the requeſt of his vine-dreſſer;
Luke 13. <hi>Whoſe end is to be burned.</hi>] When a piece of ground failes
of his croppes, and <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61860:54"/>brings forth thornes and briars, or
light ſtraw without corne, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of husband men is to kindle fires upon
it and burne it. So men bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of good workes, ſhall at length have a fire
kindled vpon them, and be burnt with everlaſting torments. Of which fire the
Author ſpeakes afterward, chap. 10.27. Now that barren land by burning is not
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, but amended; this in this ſimily is not regared: For it is
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the Authors intent, that both are burned, and land is burned
for the barrenneſſe of it, as it were to puniſh the fruitleſneſſe.
But herein is the difference, that the burning betters the barren land, but it
finally deſtroyes fruitleſſe men, and makes them moſt miſerable. For
in every ſimilitude, as we ſay, there is alſo ſome
diſſimilitude.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>But beloved</hi>] In theſe words he ſeemes to
meet with a tacite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and withall returnes to what he had before
intimated, that if need were, they ſhould not altogether deſpaire of his
laying a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againe. The Hebrewes might thinke, or gather from his
words of falling away, &amp;c. that he had no hope at all of their ſalvation.
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhews, that he doth not account them for reprobates and
accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons, who are for no other purpoſe then to be puniſhed
with eternall fire; neither doth he beleeve them in ſo miſerable and
deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n eſtate, but that he
hath a better opinion of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrote not the former words, as if
he eſteemed them ſuch: but onely to caſt ſome feare into their minds,
and diligently to warne them of taking heed, that they became not ſuch.
<hi>Beloved</hi>] This place was very ſeaſonable for that terme, leſt
they ſhould imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his hatred; but thereby might perceive
that he carried a Chriſtian love toward them, and love makes us alwayes
imagine the beſt of them we love; and when we let fall a ſharp word, it is
not done with intent to hurt, but to reforme them. <hi>We are perſwaded
better things of you</hi>] Better things then to thinke you reprobates and
reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of God, ſo that God ſhould for the preſent curſe them, and
for the future ordaine them to be burnt with fire unquenchable. <hi>And things
that accompany ſalvation</hi>] Here he oppoſeth ſalvation to male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or curſing, <hi>q.d.</hi> I am perſwaded that ye are yet in that ſtate,
that ye may be ſaved, if ye have a will to it. <hi>Though we thus
ſpeake</hi>] <hi>q.d.</hi> My former ſpeech of thoſe which fall away, and
are like barren and fruitleſſe ground, in a miſerable and unhappy
ſtate, doth nothing let, but that I am perſwaded you are in a better
eſtate; which is not therefore, as if that which he had affirmed were
leſſe certaine and true. So that in theſe words he would tacitly
mollifie, what he ſeemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have ſaid a little too ſeverely. But
that either thoſe Hebrewes were not fully fallen into the ſtate of ſuch
as fall away, becauſe they yet miniſtred to the Saints, were endued with
excellent vertues, and had not yet caſt off the Chriſtian Religion, but did
cleave unto it. Or elſe that God (as appeares by his following reaſon) had
great cauſe to <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61860:55"/>releaſe unto them that ſeverity; and
therefore, ſeeing he is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, but full of all equity and
kindneſſe, it might well be hoped that he would releaſe it. For although
theſe Hebrewes had not yet plainly revolted from Chriſt; yet they were
fallen into ſuch negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that in a manner they had need to be taught
againe the firſt principles of the Chriſtian Religion. Whence it appeares,
what cold and dull Diſciples of Chriſt they were; for which offence, if God
would deale ſeverely with them, they were worthy to be reprobated, and
finally rejected. But becauſe it is Gods manner to deale merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and
kindly with men, and to moderate his penall Laws with equity and mercy;
therefore the Author hoped better things of them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>For God is not unrighteous</hi>] Here he ſhews
the reaſon why he is perſwaded better things of them, then that God
ſhould reprobate and reject them. And the reaſon is, becauſe God will not
forget their worke and labour of love. And this he confirmes by this, becauſe
God is not unjuſt; whence it would follow, that God ſhould be unjuſt, if
he ſhould forget them. Some man may here demand how this can ſtand with
what God hath teſtified of himſelfe, Ezeck. 33.13.? <hi>If the righteous
commit iniquity; all his righteouſneſſe ſhall not be remembred: but for
his iniquity that he hath committed he ſhall dye for it.</hi> We anſwer,
that God in a diverſe reſpect is ſaid to forget a mans former vertues,
and in a diverſe not to forget them. He forgets them, in reſpect that he
juſtifies or frees from puniſhment no man by reaſon of his former vertues
if he recede from them; in which caſe Ezekiels words are to be underſtood.
And God doth not forget them, in regard he ſpares a man the longer for his
former vertues, and doth not inſtantly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or reject him, but expects
and aſſiſteth him for repentance; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be adorned with
ſome eminent vertues, ſuch as charity and bounty toward the godly, as
theſe Heb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ewes were, by the
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Author. But ſhould God be unrighteous or unjuſt, if
he had no conſideration of this? Wee anſwer. Righteouſneſſe, as
alſo unrighteouſneſſe may be taken two wayes. For righteouſneſſe
may bee taken, either for that equity which conſiſteth in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every man
his proper right; and contrarily unrighteouſneſſe may ſignifie that
iniquity which infringeth another mans right. Or righteouſneſſe may
denote ſuch an equity, as inclines rather to be neficence and kindneſſe,
and conſiſteth in giving thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man hath properly no
right; yet there may be ſome cauſes which may ſway him ſo to grant
ſomething, that if he grant it not, wee may well ſay he deals unequally and
hardly. In this latter way God may ſeem to be ſaid unrighteous, if he
ſhould be ſo unmindfull of vertues both paſt and preſent; if he
ſhould preſently reject men, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe worthy of reprobation, if
God ſhould deale with them according to his Law; and no way expect their
repentance, but wholly exclude <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61860:55"/>them from all addreſſe
to his clemency &amp; mercy; eſpecially if it appear not, that there are
ſome prevalent cauſes which reſtraine God from ſhewing mercy; as in
caſe he be to ſhew herein ſome example of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For God muſt
not preſently be ſaid unrighteous, if he deal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſeverely with
one or two; but then, when he uſually doth it, or doth it with whole
Churches. Wherefore the Author brings not here any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative or
convictive reaſon, or ſuch as that God might not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do otherwiſe
without the aſperſion of unrighteouſnes or iniquity properly ſo term'd;
but only a reaſon very probable, drawn for the moſt part from the clemencie
and mercy of God, which is voluntary in him. <hi>To forget your work and labor
of love</hi>] To ſpeak properly forgetfulnes is not incident unto God; but
figuratively he is then ſaid to forget, when he hath no regard of a thing, or
doth that which men forgetfull doe. <hi>Their work</hi> as it ſeems, was the
conflict they had in ſuffering afflictions, from their firſt entrance into
the faith of Chriſt, as the Author ſpeaks of them afterward, chap. 10 32.
Unto which work or conflict he ſubjoyns the labour of love; for in the place
laſt cited, after that conflict which they endured, the Author mentions their
offices of charity, which they exerciſed toward the Saints. And it is not
likely that in this place, where eſpecially their good works were to be
mentioned, the Author would paſſe over their nobleſt act, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
conſiſted in ſuffering for Chriſts cauſe. For Paul hath joyned
theſe two together, the work of faith and labor of love, 1 Th. 1 3. where by
the work of faith, he ſeems to underſtand their many ſufferings for the
truths ſake. For ſuch a work grows immediatly from faith; as labour and
bounty toward the Saints ſprings only from love, and is therefore called the
labor of love. And that patience which proceeds from hope is called the
patience of hope, becauſe it argues conſtancie in ſuffering afflictions
under hope of reward, and is there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the work of faith and labour of
love. <hi>Their labour of love</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother act of theirs no leſſe
acceptable to God, and no leſſe remarkable in it ſelfe. Labour of love,
is that labour which proceeds from love; or that labour whereto love puts us;
and love makes any labour light and eaſie; for nothing is more powerfull,
nothing more imperious then love. And this labour is ſeen, in helping him
whom we love, with all our ſtrength, power &amp; endeavor. <hi>Which ye have
ſhewed toward his name</hi>] Their love toward God, made them ſo deare to
God, that it would not ſuffer him to reject them, and wholly exclude them
from ſalvation. And this love was ſhewed toward the name of God, becauſe
they ſhewed it to no other end, but with reſpect to Gods name. How this was
thus effected hee preſently declares. <hi>In that ye have miniſtred to the
Saints, and doe miniſter</hi>] We ſhew love when we miniſter; and we
ſhew love toward the name of God, when we miniſter to the Saints, meerly
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe they are Saints, and conſecrate unto God. For he that
mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth to the Saints and ſhews love to the Saints, therefore becauſe
they <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61860:56"/>are Saints and beare the name of God, he ſhews love
toward the name of God; as he that miniſtreth to a Diſciple of Chriſt,
becauſe he is his Diſciple, he miniſtreth to Chriſt himſelfe. As much
as ye have done it (ſaith Chriſt) unto one of the leaſt of theſe my
brethren, yee have done it unto me, Mat. 25.40. This Miniſtery conſiſted
herein, that in the afflictions of the Saints, the Hebrews were wanting to them
in no good office, but helped them in all things to their power; as he
expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it afterward, chap. 10.33. that they became their companions in
their afflictions. And this is done, when we eſteem the affliction of an
other to be in a manner our owne; when we have a ſingular care of him, and
performe thoſe offices unto him, that wee would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to our
ſelves, if we were in his caſe. <hi>And doe miniſter.</hi>] This vertue
of miniſtering to the Saints was not yet quite ceaſed in them, albeit it
may be ſomewhat abated.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And we deſire</hi>] Here he paſſeth to the
other part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; wherein he exhorts them to a diligent and
conſtant courſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; and admoniſheth them never to faint
in their faith and hope. And he ſeemes here to take away a tacit objection,
that might ſettle in their mindes. From his laſt former words; they might
be too much advanced in hope, to believe that now all muſt needs goe well
with them; ſeeing God without being unrighteous could not forget the things
they had done and ſuffered, and did yet doe and ſuffer for Gods cauſe.
Leſt they ſhould fall to imagine this, the Author ſhews them what he
would have them yet doe, and what he yet findes wanting in them; if they meant
to retaine and aſſured hope of ſalvation. Hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds very prudently
with them, when a little before, hee ſeemed to have terrified them too much,
and to debarre them from all hope of ſalvation; he againe erected them, and
ſhewed that he did not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this, but that he was perſwaded
better things of them. And now againe, leſt they ſhould be too confident of
themſelves and bee puſſed up in minde, and flatter themſelves with an
infallible hope of ſalvation; he ſhews them their wants, that being thus
reduced to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they might neither deſpair of ſalvation nor
preſume of it. <hi>That every one of you, do ſhew the ſame
diligence</hi>] He calls not only upon the whole Church in generall, but upon
each perſon ſingly, to continue the ſame diligence and endeavor, that
they had done from their firſt recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel. <hi>To the full
aſſurance of hope</hi>] To be aſſured of a thing is to have a knowledge
of it, that it is thus or thus. And a full aſſurance is a full and certain
knowledge, or as we vulgarly ſpeak, it is a certainty. And a full
aſſurance of hope is a certainty of thoſe things that are the object or
matter of our hope. And the hope here ment, is the Chriſtian hope, whoſe
object is eternal ſalvation; wherof our Chriſtian hope is an expectation.
And this hope is advanced &amp; augmented by our conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in faith and good
works; wherby it is daily more and more aſſured; <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61860:56"/>and
the aſſurance of it daily made more full. They had a hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
grounded upon the promiſes of God, and quickned by the worke they had done
and yet did for Gods cauſe: but a full aſſurance of hope they had not;
for they had not yet fulfilled the meaſure of Chriſtian duties, whereof how
much was wanting, ſo much they wanted of full aſſurance, becauſe ſo
much their hope was the leſſe. <hi>Vnto the end.</hi>] Theſe words may be
referred to their diligence, that they ſhould continue that to the end. Or
they may be referred to their aſſurance of hope, that it might laſt to
the end. For a man may gaine a full aſſurance of eternall life, and yet
loſe it again.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>That yee be not ſlothfull</hi>]
Slothfulneſſe is then when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more remiſſe in the wayes and
workes of godlineſſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his deſire is, that they would
conſtantly hold on to the end, the ſame courſe of godlineſſe which
they held at the beginning. For a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſenes and ſlowneſſe ariſeth
from the remiſſenes and faintneſſe of our faith. And this is the ſame
fault in them which he reproved before in the 4. chap. ver. 1. and chap. 5.11.
<hi>But followers of them who through faith and patience</hi>] To their
ſlothfulneſſe he oppoſeth faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe faith and
patience are as a remedy to cure their ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the courſe of
godlineſſe. Faith is a truſting to Gods promiſes; and patience in this
place ſignifies perſeverance and conſtancie in faith; or a conſtant and
laſting expectation of his promiſes, although they ſeem to be deferred.
This patience requires not only, that no delay of time ſhould weaken our
faith; but alſo that no evills or adverſities ſhould diſcourage it: for
if by faith we meane to attaine Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we muſt looke for many
ſufferings to intervene in the mean while. For in this ſenſe the
Apoſtle uſeth the word patience, Jam. 5.7,8. who thoſe men be, of whom
they ſhould be followers in faith and patience, he ſhews in the following
verſe, namely that they are the Patriarkes, whereof he names Abraham as the
principall. <hi>Inherit the promiſes.</hi>] This is the fruit of our faith
and patience to inherit the promiſes of our faith: And this he adds the more
to excite them to a conſtancy in faith and patience to the end; becauſe
thereby they ſhall reap the excellent fruit thereof by inheriting the
promiſes. He faith inherit, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenſe, becauſe the
preſent tenſe is commonly put indefinitly for any time, that the mindes of
the readers might be drawne as it were to a thing preſent.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>For when God made promiſe to Abraham</hi>] In
theſe words hee gives not a reaſon, why they ſhould be followers of
ſuch as inherit the promiſes: but he onely gives a reaſon why he makes
mention of ſuch. For ſome man might demand whether there were any ſuch to
be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and who they were? In theſe words therefore for an example
thereof, hee produceth Abraham the father of the faithfull, who was moſt
patient and conſtant in his faith, and reaped the greateſt fruit of 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61860:57"/>his faith. And firſt he ſhewes that Abraham had the
promiſe of God, upon which his faith relyed; then at the 15. verſe, hee
mentions the conſtancy of his faith, and alſo the fruit of it. Upon the
mention of Gods promiſe made to Abraham, hee mentions alſo the oath of God;
whereby God would confirme his promiſe to him. This he therefore doth,
becauſe the ſame promiſe belongs to us alſo in a myſticall &amp;
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fence, as a little after we ſhall ſhew; &amp; therefore we ſhould
apply the greater &amp; ſtronger faith unto it; and therein be followers of
Abraham, and other Patriarks that followed him. And we muſt note the manner
of ſpeech which the Author here uſeth; he ſaith not that God promiſed
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham before he ſware, but when he made promiſe, or in promiſing he
ſware; that the truth may appeare of what we noted before, that indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Participles joyned with a Verbe of the preter tenſe, muſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be
underſtood of the time paſt, but often of the preſent; So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
chap. 9.12. Chriſt is ſaid to have entered into the holy place by his owne
blood, having obtained eternal redemption for us; Not that Chriſt obtained
that redemption before he entered; but that hee obtained it at his entrance:
whereof we ſhal ſpeak further there. But by the way, the Author ſhews the
cauſe, why God did ſweare by himſelf; when he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe he
could ſweare by no greater, hee ſware by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>] Therefore he
ſware not by another, becauſe then he, by whom he was to ſwear, muſt be
greater then himſelfe, as ſuch a one that muſt be invocated as an avenger
of his violating of his oath, and whom by this meanes the ſwearer muſt
revere and adore. But God hath none whom he ſhould feare as an avenger, none
whom he ſhould adore as a Deity to him; and conſequently hath none greater
then himſelf; where fore if God will ſweare upon any occaſion (as the
occaſion is expreſt, verſe 16.) he muſt needs ſweare by himſelfe.
And when the Author ſaith of God that he did ſweare, he reſpects the
words whereby God made promiſe to Abraham, ſaying, <hi>By my ſelfe have I
ſworn,</hi> Gen. 22.16. But the ſolemne form whereby God uſeth to
ſwear, is, <hi>As I live</hi>] <hi>q. d.</hi> Let me not be accounted for the
living God; for all other formes are referred and reduced to this. As when hee
is ſaid to ſweare by his ſoule, by his life, by his holineſſe, by his
arme (that is his ſtrength and power) and by his right hand, (that is his
faith.)</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>Saying,</hi>] He rehearſeth the ſumme of Gods
promiſe made to Abraham. <hi>Surely,</hi>] In the originall it is <hi>a
men,</hi> or <hi>e men;</hi> which is an Adverb of ſweating; commonly put
after a Verbe whereby wee doe aſſevere, that a thing is true or ſhall be
done. For as an oath is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of ſome thing aſſerted or
promiſed; ſo every Confirmation is an aſſurance to him who receives it;
and therefore the word <hi>Surely</hi> is properly an Adverb of ſwearing. Yet
in many paſſages of Scripture, the word Surely is but an Adverb of
Aſſeveration, which is a leſſe and lower Confirmation then an oath.
<hi>Bleſsing, I will bleſſe thee, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying, <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61860:57"/>I will multiply thee.</hi>] This promiſe in ſome places of
Scripture, is indeed delivered in other words: but theſe make up the generall
ſum of it. And the gemination or doubling of the words, according to the
idiome of the Hebrewes doth intend and magnifie the thing; I will greatly
bleſſe, and greatly multiply. This promiſe is deſcribed. Gen. 22.16.
But wee are to note, that this promiſe pertaines not onely to Abraham, but
alſo to his ſeed; Or if wee reſpect the literall or carnall ſence of
this promiſe, Abraham is promiſed to be greatly bleſſed in his ſeed:
for the bleſſing conſiſted in this, as God himſelfe declares, that
God would multiply Abrahams ſeed as the ſtarres of heaven, or as the ſand
upon the ſea-ſhore; that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſſe the gates of
their enemies; and all nations ſhould be bleſſed in him. <hi>i.</hi> He
ſhould have a poſterity moſt numerous and moſt happy: All which
particulars pertain to Abraham no otherwiſe then by his ſeed. But if wee
reſpect the ſpirituall ſence of that promiſe, the bleſſing of
Abraham muſt be diſtinguiſhed from his multiplying, and the bleſſing
will conſiſt in his juſtification, as the Apoſtle teacheth us, Gal.
3.8,9. wherein we muſt include his eternall happineſſe: which
bleſſing pertaines not onely to Abraham, but alſo to his ſpirituall
ſeed, which is Chriſt. <hi>i.</hi> all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people; whereof, ſee
Gal. 3.16. But the multiplying muſt bee referred to the innumerable multitude
of beleevers; for all that beleeve in Chriſt, are the children and
poſteritie of Abraham, Rom. 4.16,17. and Gal. 3.9.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And ſo after he had patiently endured, he
obtained the promiſes.</hi>] Now he mentions the conſtant faith of Abraham,
and the fruit of his faith. For that Abraham did long expect the promiſes of
God, and expected till his death, and died in the faith, is well known from the
hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of Moſes, and the Author declares it afterward, chap. 11.13. And
his poſterity could not be ignorant, but that he obtained the promiſe in a
literall ſence. But the ſpirituall bleſſing which conſiſted in his
perfect juſtification and eternall ſalvation; as alſo in the multitude of
beleevers, how this was performed unto him, we ſee. For we ſee him the
Father of ſo many nations, and we ſee that God was not aſhamed to call
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his God, even when hee was dead; whereof hereafter, Chap.
11.16.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>For men verily ſweare by the greater</hi>] Here
he gives the reaſon, why he ſaid, that God did ſweare by himſelfe and
not by another greater then himſelfe. Becauſe men when they ſweare, they
ſweare by another greater, but God ſeeing he hath none greater then
himſelf, ſweares by himſelfe. The Author therefore ſhewes the
difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween divine and humane oaths; for God ſwears otherwiſe then
men doe. Men when they ſweare, ſweare by a greater then themſelves,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have another greater then themſelves, namely God. But God,
who hath none greater then himſelfe, when he ſweares, muſt 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61860:58"/>needs ſweare by himſelfe. <hi>And an oath for
confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Here he ſhewes the
certain force and uſe of oaths, that an oath doth determine and end every
controverſie ariſing betweene men; when one affirmes and another denies,
and the point cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be certainly knowne, for then in ſuch a
caſe an oath is rightly required. An <hi>oath for confirmation.</hi> An oath
required in controverſie doth confirme the ſaying of the one party, and
thereby it determines and ends the ſtrife. For that is accounted firme and
certaine, which is affirmed and proved upon oath.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly</hi>]
Wherein, <hi>i.</hi> For which cauſe or by reaſon whereof. For becauſe
that an oath doth confirme and certifie a thing uncertaine and doubtfull; and
by the interpoſing thereof, the controverſie is ended; therefore and for
that reaſon God being willing to ſhew more abundantly the immutabilitie of
his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, interpoſed his oath. <hi>More abundantly to ſhew the
immutability of his counſell.</hi>] The end of Gods oath was to ſhew the
immutability of his counſell and purpoſe in bleſſing Abraham and his
ſeed. Hee ſaith not ſimply, that God was willing to ſhew his
immutabilitie, but to ſhew it more abundantly; becauſe God by a ſimple
aſſeveration without any oath, could have abundantly ſhewen, with what an
immutable counſell he had decreed to bleſſe Abraham and his ſeed; but
that hee might ſhew it yet more abundantly, and ſo fully that nothing might
be wanting to the confirmation of it, therefore over and above he added his
oath. <hi>Vnto the heires of promiſe</hi>] The perſons whom God would
ſhew this ſo abundantly, were the heirs of promiſe, to whom the things
promiſed do appertain. And to whom elſe doe they appertain, but to Abraham
Iſaac, Iacob, and their ſeed; which being two-fold, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and
carnall, therefore the promiſes pertaine to the carnall ſeed in a carnall
ſence, and to the ſpirituall in a ſence ſpirituall. To Abraham and to
his ſeed was promiſed an inheritance and bleſſing, and an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
into Gods reſt, whereof hee treated above, chap. 4. In a carnall ſence we
muſt here underſtand the Inheritance of the land of Canaan, and an earthly
happineſſe, which long ſince was performed to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeed of
Abraham: but in the ſpirituall ſence, it is perfect juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
immortall life, which is performed to his ſpirituall ſeed. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it by an oath.</hi>] Or rather as it is in the margin, he interpoſed it by
oath. God interpoſed and engaged his oath as an hoſtage or ſurety, that
the faith of his promiſe might be ſecured to the heires of the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>That by two immutable things.</hi> Gods promiſe
and his oath are two things immutable, whereof neither can faile, for Gods oath
is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; and makes his promiſe irrevocable, and and ſo both become
immutable. <hi>In which it was impoſsible for God to lie.</hi>] Not that it
is poſſible for God ever to lie, though he ſpeake not upon oath; but
that, <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61860:58"/>howſoever to ſome man it may ſeeme
poſſible in other matters, yet in his promiſe, and that confirmed by
oath, wherein man may poſſibly lye, yet it is impoſſible for God to
lye; yea, (as I may ſay) it is moſt farre from all likelihood or ſhew of
poſſibility. God deſcends thus to our infirmity, when according to the
manner of men that would be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, he binds his faith unto us, not in bare
words, but with the bond of an oath; that if we beleeve men upon the bond of
their oath, much more ſhould we thinke it an impiety not to beleeve the
moſt holy God upon his. And there are ſome learned men, who thinke that the
word <hi>lye</hi> in this place, hath ſomewhat a larger extent, to include
alſo that which ſeemes to have any ſhew of fraud or deceit; as when he
that ſweares conceales ſome condition, the non-performance whereof may
fruſtrate the event of the oath, in reſpect of his intention or expectation
to whom the oath was made. <hi>Wee might have a ſtrong conſolation</hi>]
Conſolation or comfort then ariſeth to us, when wee have a hope of ſome
happineſſe: but a great and ſtrong comfort proceeds from a hope of the
higheſt happineſſe, when our hope thereof is moſt certaine and
infallible, ſuch as is the hope of eternall ſalvation, aſſured upon the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oath of God. <hi>Who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
hope ſet before us.</hi>] He ſpeakes not of every hope, but of the hope of
Chriſtians; and of that hope which is ſet before us, namely the hope of
eternall life; which hope God himſelfe hath ſet before us by calling us
unto it, and giving the meanes to attaine it, namely his promiſe and oath,
high pledges and ſeales for our aſſurance of it. And wee have fled for
refuge to lay hold of it; for as if we had beene driven downe with ſome
ſurious ſtorme or tempeſt, wherein otherwiſe wee ſhould have
periſhed, we have fled to this hope as to a ſacred anchor, to lay hold upon
it: To lay hold, is to graſpe a thing faſt with our hand; which ſhews how
cloſely and firmely we ſhould apply our minde to this hope, becauſe it is
the onely refuge we have in all our dangers and diſtreſſes. In all
theſe words the heires of the promiſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Which we have as an anchor of the ſoule</hi>]
He now explicates the ſimily which before he had but intimated. Our hope of
eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he compares to a firme and ſtrong anchor; and our
ſoule ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by this hope, he likens to a ſhip riding at anchor. Our
hope of eternall ſalvation is an anchor to our ſoule; becauſe, as long as
our ſoule is held by this anchor, it is not beaten with any tempeſts of
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, nor broken with rocks and flats, and therefore in no danger of
being wrecked. <hi>Both ſure and ſtedfaſt</hi>] Theſe be the chiefe
qualities of a good anchor; firſt that the cable be ſure and breake not,
and then that the anchor be ſtedfaſt and come not home. For, if the anchor
faile in either of theſe reſpects, the ſhip is in danger to be loſt.
And an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor indeed doth many times faile, for either it comes home, or the 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61860:59"/>cable breakes: but the anchor of our hope can never faile,
and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may aſſure our ſelves upon it. <hi>And which entreth
into that within the vaile</hi>] That an anchor may be ſure and ſtedfaſt,
this alſo is required in it, that being faſtened to the ſhip, it ſinke
downe to the bottome of the ſea, and that there it lye not upon the face of
the ground, but pierce deepe within the ground. The like quality is in the
anchor of our hope; all the difference is, that the anchor of the ſhip falls
downeward, but the anchor of our hope flies upward, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto heaven
it ſelfe, and pierceth inwardly into the very cloſets of it. The Author
would rather ſignifie heaven by the word <hi>vaile,</hi> then call it by the
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oper name, becauſe he would
prepare himſelfe a paſſage, or rather a returne to his intended
treatiſe of Chriſts Prieſthood, from whence hitherto he had
digreſſed. For, having made mention of the vaile that hanged in the
Sanctuary, and parted it from the Oracle or moſt holy place, he preſently
takes occaſion to ſpeake of the high Prieſt, whoſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oper office it was to enter within that
vaile into the moſt holy place. And therefore he adds.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Whither the fore-runner is for us entred</hi>]
Thus hee ſpeakes of Chriſt, that withall he may tacitly ſhew the cauſe,
why our hope ſhould flye ſo high and enter into heaven; namely, becauſe
our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner Jeſus Chriſt is entred there, and entred there for us. He
calls Chriſt our fore-runner, becauſe he is the guide of our journey
thither, and goes before, leading thither the whole Army of Saints. He as
ſoone as he entered heaven, drew thither our hope with him. Neither did he
enter heaven as a bare guide to us in our journey thither, to ſhew us the way
thither onely by his example, that we might not ſtray or faile of the right
path; but he entred heaven alſo as a ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>binger, there to prepare a place for us that ſhould follow him;
for ſo he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of himſelfe, in ſaying, <hi>In my Fathers
houſe are many manſions &amp;c. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
go and prepare a place for you I will come ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine and receive you unto my ſelfe, that where I am, there may ye
be alſo,</hi> John 14.2,3. This the Author alſo teacheth us, by ſaying
<hi>for us.</hi> Chriſt is entred heaven for us, even for our ſakes, to
procure unto us eternall ſalvation and happineſſe there. <hi>Even Ieſus
made a high Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> In that
Chriſt is made our heavenly and eternall high Prieſt, therefore eternall
ſalvation is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for us. For it cannot be, but ſo great a high
Prieſt doth fully expiate our ſins, doth turne away from us all Gods wrath,
and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever puniſhments we have deſerved, doth procure us eternall
life, which is the promiſed effect of Gods favour; eſpecially ſeeing our
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is in his hand, and left to his diſpoſe. For hence it comes to
paſſe, that our hope doth raiſe it ſelfe up unto heaven and hides it
ſelfe with Chriſt in the manſions of it; and therefore doth ſo firmely
ſupport our ſoules, that they cannot be wrecked with any ſtormes of
evils. And <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61860:59"/>ſo the Author makes entrance to his intended
treatiſe of Chriſt Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which followes in the next Chapter.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or this Melchiſedec</hi>] The particle
<hi>for</hi> ſhews, that the Author would give a reaſon, of his laſt
words in the former Chapter, why Chriſt is ſaid to be made a Prieſt after
the order of Melchiſedec; namely, becauſe between Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec and
Chriſt there is a great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and likeneſſe. For, Melchiſedec
had a name and a kingdome moſt agreeable to that of Chriſt; he was a
perſon of ſo great dignity, that he exceeded the Patriarch Abraham
himſelfe; and laſtly, in the order of his Prieſthood he was like unto
Chriſt. <hi>King of Salem</hi>] It is manifeſt that Salem was a City ſo
called wherein Melchiſedec reigned. For, we cannot aſſent to them who
ſay, that he was not truly king of Salem, but onely called ſo, becauſe
his name ſignified ſo, as it alſo ſignified <hi>King of
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> But if this had beene onely an appellation of him,
the Author would not have ſaid king of Salem, but Melechſalem; as he ſaid
not King of Sedec, but Melchiſedec. For, who in relating of a mans name, will
deliver it partly in a ſtrange language, and partly in the proper language.
Wherefore, when Melchiſedec is in Scripture called king of Salem, it is
apparent; that the name of King doth note his royall office and dignity; and
Salem notes the place wherein he did reigne. And many beeleeve, that this City
Salem, was the ſame with Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which at the firſt was called onely
Salem, and afterward by the adjection of the word Jeru, Jeruſalem, as a man
would ſay, the <hi>ſight of peace. Prieſt of the moſt high God</hi>]
For ſo the Scripture calls him, Gen. 14.18. And though the word Cohen
ſignifie alſo a Prince, as the Sons of David are ſaid to have beene
Cohenim, 2 Sam. 8.18. which our Tranſlation there renders chiefe rulers; yet
being attributed to Melchiſedec, it notes him a Prieſt. 1. Becauſe of
that addition here made <hi>of the moſt high God;</hi> for this addition
takes away all ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the word, and declares him to be a Prieſt of
God, and not a Prince of God. 2. Becauſe this is brought as a reaſon, why
he bleſſed Abraham in an eſpeciall manner, as ſhall be ſhewed
afterward. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Abraham payed him tithes, which were uſually paid to
Prieſts. Whence it appeares, that the ſame word Cohen, which is given to
Chriſt as he is compared with Melchiſedec, Pſal. 110.4. doth not ſimply
ſignifie a Prince onely, as the Jews contend, but properly a Prieſt. For,
it is manifeſt that thoſe words of the Pſalme have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61860:60"/>to the place in Geneſis, where Melchiſedec is called
Cohen. And it is no ſtrange thing, that anciently Melchiſedec was both a
King and a Prieſt; for anciently Kings were wont to performe Sacred rites;
which cuſtome grew from hence, that in every family the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall perſon
or ruler of it, did officate in holy functions. Whence it came to paſſe,
that they who afterward became Princes or Rulers of a whole Citie, became
alſo the publike Prieſts of that Citie, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſacred
Ceremonies for the ſafety of the people: For it made moſt for the honour of
God, that the moſt honourable perſon ſhould miniſter unto him. <hi>Who
met Abraham returning from the ſlaughter of the Kings</hi>] The Author
mentions not this meeting, as if in that, there were any Myſterie: but
becauſe he would ſhew how Melchiſedec bleſſed Abraham, and
reciprocally how Abraham gave tithes to Melchiſedec. In which two points as
he ſhews afterward, the chiefe dignitie of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec appeared. And hee
mentions this meeting onely to deſigne the occaſion, the time and
circumſtances of the action: whereof the Hiſtory is particularly related.
Gen. 14. <hi>And bleſſed him</hi>] Him, <hi>i.</hi> Abraham; for ſo
ſaith the Scripture, <hi>He bleſſed him and ſaid, Bleſſed be
Abraham of the moſt high God, poſſeſſour of heaven and earth,</hi>
Gen. 14.19. that is, Let the moſt high God bleſſe Abraham, and heap his
gifts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in great abundance. And leſt any man ſhould think that this
was but an ordinary bleſſing, ſuch as commonly is among friends when they
mutually pray and wiſh all happineſſe one to another; therefore he
prefixed theſe words before it, that Melchiſedec was a Prieſt of the
moſt high God; thereby to make us know, that this was a ſingular
bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as proceeding from a perſon that was a peculiar Miniſter of
God. Whence it appears, that when Melchiſedec is ſaid to be a Prieſt of
the moſt high God; thereby is not ſhewed the reaſon why he brought forth
bread and wine, as they would have it, who ſay that Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec offered
bread and wine to God, and was therefore called a Prieſt: but in thoſe
words is ſhewed the reaſon why he bleſſed Abraham, and why (as it
preſently follows) Abraham gave him tithes. But the error of theſe men, who
thereby would ſtrengthen their owne opinions may manifeſtly be convinced
from hence, that the Author who moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently proſecutes the
likeneſſe betweene the Prieſthood of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec and Chriſt, makes
not any the leaſt mention of offering bread and wine, wherein
notwithſtanding they thinke, the greateſt likeneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt
and Melchiſedec doth conſiſt, and certainly muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, if both
offered bread and wine. Either therefore the Author omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that which was the
maine point in ſo accurate a compariſon of Chriſt with Melchiſedec, or
elſe that Melchiſedec, or Chriſt, or both of them offered bread and wine
to God, is but thoſe mens dream. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec brought forth bread and wine,
that hee might refreſh Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his company, that were weary after their
victory and journey: <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61860:61"/>but hee offered none to God; for this
is refuted by the very word of bringing forth, which is never uſed of
offerings: and beſides the place and time, when this is ſaid to have been
done, refutes it alſo. For wee uſe not to meet men upon the way, there to
celebrate divine ſervices or performe holy Ceremonies. Alſo Chriſt is
never read to have offered bread and wine to God: but onely to have
inſtituted a holy Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, wherein bread is broken and eaten, and wine is
drunke out of a cup: yet not to perform any offering; but to celebrate the
memory of Chriſt, whoſe body was broken for us, and his blood ſhed for
us. As for the expiatory offering of Chriſt for our ſinnes; that was not
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on earth, but in heaven. Hebrewes 8.4. Neither doth it conſiſt
in offering of bread and wine, but in Chriſts offering of himſelfe; as this
Authour teſtifies in ſundry places; neither was it to bee iterated often,
but once onely to bee performed, as the Authour clearely delivers it afterwards
in this Chapter, verſe 27. and Chap. 10 14. For that ſingle oblation
perfects all the Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To whom alſo Abraham gave a tenth part of
all</hi>] The fifth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that the Author obſerves in Melchiſedec,
was, that Abraham gave him the tenth part (as is related in his hiſtory;)
whence a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Author collects, how far Melchiſedec exceeded the
Leviticall Prieſts. The gift that Abraham gave him was a part of the
ſpoiles; for ſo it is expreſſed, at the 4. v. following, and the
portion hee gave was a tenth part of them; and there were none of the ſpoils
excepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for he gave him a tenth part of all. By theſe words
hee partly explicates ſome things related in Scripture of Melchiſedec, and
partly obſerves other things, whereby to make it appeare, how great a
perſon Melchiſedec was, and how properly he was a type of Chriſt.
<hi>Firſt, being by interpretation king of righteouſneſſe.</hi>]
Firſt he ponders the name of Melchiſedec, and teacheth that there was an
omen in his name. For the Hebrew name Melchiſedec being interpreted or
tranſlated into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other language, doth ſignifie <hi>a king of
righteouſneſſo.</hi>] There are ſome who tell us, that this name
ſignifies, <hi>my righteous king:</hi> but it is very uſuall with the
Hebrewes in Nownes compounded to adde 1 to the firſt Nowne, for ſweet
ſounding and ornament, as Adoniſedec, Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſec, Abimelech, Achimelech,
Haminadab, Abiſag, &amp;c. and the ſame is done alſo in Melchiſedec.
From theſe words it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that this Epiſtle was not
written in Hebrew but in Greek; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe muſt be the words of a
Greeke interpreter, or of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Author; of a Greeke interpreter they
cannot be; ſeeing they are a part of the Text it ſelfe, and of the
reaſoning therein. The words of an Hebrew Authour how can they bee? For what
could bee more vaine; then firſt to interpret the name Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec and
Salem to the Hebrewes, ſeeing none of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61860:61"/>could be ignorant of the ſenſe of theſe names? and then to
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Melchiſedec Melechſedec, and Melechſalem Melechſalem. For
ſo theſe names muſt needs be interpreted, if this Epiſtle were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Hebrew; unleſſe an Hebrew Author, writing Hebrew names to the Hebrewes,
ſhould interpret them by another language then the Hebrew. It is therefore
apparent that the Writer of this Epiſtle was a Greeke, who interprets the
Hebrew name Melchiſedec and Salem; and from theſe very appellations doth
tacitly draw an argument, to ſhew that Melchiſedec is a moſt elegant type
of Chriſt, who is a King, of all others the moſt righteous and moſt
peaceable. Whence Eſay 9.6. he is called <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi>
becauſe he eſpecially hateth and abhorreth warres, neither cares he to be
famous for warres, as the Kings of this world do, but onely for peace; and
withall is moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in himſelfe, and the author of true happineſſe
to his people. For, as it is well knowne, the word peace among the Hebrewes
ſignifies alſo all happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Without father, without mother</hi>] He hath
ſhewed that Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck was a Prieſt of the moſt High God; now hee
further declares what manner of Prieſt he was, and in that reſpect how far
he was unlike to the Leviticall Prieſts; and contrarily how like unto
Chriſt. In the Leviticall Prieſt, eſpecially in the high Prieſt, the
chiefeſt regard of all was, to know of what father, what mother, and of what
family hee came. But in the Prieſt Melchiſedeck, it is apparent, there was
no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at all had of this; ſeeing the Scripture which teſtifies of him
that he was a Prieſt, hath declared neither his father, nor mother, nor
fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Melchiſedeck therefore is ſaid to be without father and mother,
not that hee had no father or mother; but becauſe neither his father nor
mother are declared or mentioned in the annalls of the Scripture. For even
among prophane Writers they whoſe pedigree and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was unknowne, were
ſaid to be of no family, and to have neither father nor mother.
<hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeakes very well upon theſe words of the Author. 
<q rend="inline">"The holy Scripture (ſaith he) relates the
Genealogie of Abraham and many others, as well who went before him as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after: ſhe mentions his father, grandfather and great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and all
his direct anceſtors; ſhe addes alſo that when he was ſo many years old
he begat a ſon, &amp; when ſo many that he dyed. But ſhe ſhewes not the
father nor parentage of Melchiſedeck, nor how long he lived, nor when he
dyed."</q> Beſides, in ordaining the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prieſthood it muſt be
knowne of what family he was; for of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he muſt be of the family
of Aaron, as Aaron himſelfe was of the tribe of Levi; unto which tribe Jacob
the Patriarch had Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deſigned the Prieſthood, as he had the
Kingdome to the tribe of Judah. Regard alſo was had of his mother; for ſhe
muſt be an Iſraelite one of the twelve tribes; otherwiſe the ſonne
borne of her, being a <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61860:62"/>ſtranger though married to the
high Prieſt, was illegitimate for the Prieſthood; and alſo the high
Prieſt muſt neceſſarily be borne of a woman that was married to his
father when ſhe was a virgin, or was the widow of ſome other Prieſt; and
one that was not of a plebeian and vulgar family; whereof ſee Lev. 21.13.
<hi>Without deſcent, or pedigree</hi>] Whoſe genealogy or pedigree is not
declared in Scripture. For a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree is a declaration of a mans parentage or
deſcent: He is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcent or parentage that hath no parentage at
all; but becauſe his parentage is not mentioned or extant, and therefore not
knowne. And by this word it may appeare in what ſenſe the Author ſaid
that Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedek was without father, and without mother; namely, becauſe
as there is no mention in Scripture of his pedigree and anceſtors, no
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his parents; whereof the former is conſequent to the latter. For
hee whoſe parents are unknowne, how ſhould his pedigree and deſcent be
knowne? <hi>Having neither beginning of dayes nor end of life</hi>] Dayes may
here be taken, not for the time of his life, but for the time of his
Prieſthood when that began or ended; for ſo the Scripture mentions the
dayes of Herod and of John Baptiſt. And in this ſenſe Melchiſedeck is
ſaid to have neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life, becauſe the
Scripture declares not, at what time his Prieſthood began, nor when it ended;
to make it hereby appeare, that in his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there was no reſpect had
either of his predeceſſor or ſucceſſor. For therefore in every
Prieſt the beginning and ending of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is noted, that it might
thence appeare what predeceſſor and what ſucceſſor each Prieſt had.
And further the end of life is fitly oppoſed to the beginning of his
Prieſthood; becauſe the Prieſthood expired not but with his life. But if
by <hi>Dayes</hi> we underſtand the time of his life, then we muſt
acknowledge, that the beginning of his life is mentioned only for oppoſition
and amplifications ſake: For it was enough for the Author to ſhew that
Melchiſedeck had no knowne ſucceſſor in his Prieſthood; that in this
reſpect he might be a type of Chriſt, which he expreſſeth by ſaying,
he had no end of life. But being willing to ſay yet more for illuſtrations
ſake, he affirmes, that as he had no end of life, ſo he had no beginning of
it; and therefore no marvell if the end of his life were not mentioned, when
the beginning of it was concealed. <hi>But made like unto the Son of God,
abideth a Prieſt continually</hi>] But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared or likened unto Chriſt,
abides a Prieſt perpetually, and without any ſucceſſor. He doth in
theſe words further yet illuſtrate the point from the contrary.
Melchiſedec hath no end of life, but remaines a Prieſt perpetually or for
ever. And when hee would ſignifie where the Scripture teſtifies this, he
ſaith, made like unto the Sonne of God; <hi>q.d.</hi> There the Scripture
teſtifies it, where ſhe compares and likens him to Chriſt. For the
Scripture no where expreſly ſaith of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec alone by himſelfe,
that he abides a Prieſt for ever, but only in <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61860:62"/>comparing
him with Chriſt, in the very words ſpoken of Chriſt, Thou art a Prieſt
for ever after the order of Melchiſedec. In which words the Scripture doth
withall inſinuate tacitly and by force of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, that
Melchiſedec was a Prieſt for ever, and takes it as it were for granted. For
unleſſe ſhe firſt ſuppoſe the perpetuity of Melchiſedecs
Prieſthood, how could ſhe in this reſpect make Chriſt like unto
Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec? The Author ſaith, that Melchiſedec was like unto Chriſt,
when it ſeems he ſhould rather have ſaid, that Chriſt was like to
Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec. Yet the Author not only might ſpeake ſo, but in a manner
muſt. He might ſay ſo, becauſe things alike are mutually ſo, and each
is like the other. And hee muſt, becauſe when the Author would ſpeake
roundly, and referre the words of the Pſalme, Thou art a Prieſt for ever,
directly to Melchiſedec himſelfe; Melchiſedec muſt be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the
firſt place, and not the Sonne of God; and therefore he is rightly inferred
to be like the Sonne of God, and not the Sonne of God like him. For otherwiſe
either the words of the Pſalme muſt ſeem to bee referred to the Sonne of
God, as the Pſalme it ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres them, and not directly ſpoken of
Melchiſedec by the Author; or certainly the perpetuity of Melchiſedec
muſt be aſſerted by this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture ſome other way yet
not ſo roundly and briefly. And beſides, the Author would tacitly ſhew by
this manner of ſpeech, that the perpetuity of Melchiſedec, was but typicall
and umbratilous compared to the eternity of Chriſt; and therefore in this
reſpect, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec was rather to be likened to Chriſt, then Chriſt
to Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec. <hi>Abideth a Prieſt continually</hi>] That abides
continually, which hath no intermiſſion or ceſſation from being; which
being applied to time ſignifies perpetuity. How Melchiſedec is a Prieſt
abiding perpetually and for ever, the Prieſthood of his antitype who is
Chriſt, may teach us. Chriſt is therefore a Prieſt abiding for ever,
becauſe his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood laſteth a long time, and ſo long as there is
any uſe of a Prieſthood, or ſo long as the ſtate of things ſhall ſo
continue that there is no further need of any Prieſthood: And then there
ſhall be no further need of any, when the people of God are tranſlated into
heaven, and ſhall need no further expiation of their ſinnes. So alſo
Melchiſedec was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Prieſt, becauſe his Prieſthood laſted a
very long time, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it the knowledge and worſhip of the true
God among men was extinguiſhed; ſo that there was no further place or uſe
of that Prieſthood that was dedicate to the true God. For a thing is ſaid
to abide for ever, which both laſteth a long time, and alſo ſo long as
the nature of the thing will beare. So David ſaith, that he will praiſe God
for ever; ſo the Law is ſaid eternall; and the Goſpel in this ſenſe
is called eternall; and many other things in like manner. This way
Melchiſedec is called an eternall Prieſt, though in reference to Chriſt
his Prieſthood compared to the Prieſthood of Chriſt hath but an 
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61860:63"/>umbratilous eternity, as the ſhadow to the body. For if
the likeneſſe were in every reſpect, then there would not be a figure and
a truth, but either both figures or both truths. Therefore the likeneſſe
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Melchiſedec and Chriſt in this place, conſiſteth in three
things. 1. As in the Prieſthood of Melchiſedec there was no reſpect had
of his parentage or family; for he is ſaid to be without father, mother and
deſcent: ſo neither in the Prieſthood of Chriſt, who according to the
fleſh deſcended from that Tribe, who had no title to the Prieſthood. 2.
That both were perpetuall Prieſts for ever; Melchiſedec in an um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratilous
and figurative way, but Chriſt ſolidly and really. 3. As Melchiſedec in
his Prieſthood had no predeceſſor nor ſucceſſor; ſo neither had
Chriſt in his.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Now conſider how great this man was</hi>] Here
begins another part of the Chapter, wherein the Author ſhews, how farre
Melchiſedec ſurpaſſeth in dignity the Leviticall Prieſts. That from
thence it might appeare, how farre more worthy that Prieſt is, who is after
the order of Melchiſedec, and of whom Melchiſedec was but a ſhadow; for
ſuch a Prieſt muſt needs farre ſurpaſſe any Prieſt that is after
the order of Aaron. For, if the ſhadow were ſo excellent, what ſhall we
attribute to the body it ſelfe? Now that Melchiſedec was a more worthy
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then the Leviticall Prieſts, he proves by three reaſons. 1.
Becauſe Abraham gave him tithes. 2. Becauſe he bleſſed Abraham. 3.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereupon the Scripture teſtifies, that he lives for ever. He calls
therefore upon the Hebrewes to conſider this man, that he might ſtirre them
up to ponder and weigh the dignity of Melchiſedec, <hi>q.d.</hi> I have
briefly declared unto you from Scripture, how farre ſhe ſpeakes or is
ſilent concerning Melchiſedec. Now conſider and ponder the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
well, that thence ye may know how farre he excells the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prieſts.
<hi>Vnto whom even the Patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the ſpoiles</hi>]
The dignity of Melchiſedec above the Leviticall Prieſts, appeares firſt
from this, that even Abraham gave him tithes. The particle <hi>even</hi> may be
referred to Abraham; and then it ſeemes added to exaggerate and amplifie the
dignity of Melchiſedec from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Abraham; that not ſome vulgar
perſon, but even Abraham him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gave him tithes. And to this opinion it
elegantly agrees, that to the name of Abraham is added the title of Patriarch,
and that with the article <hi>the</hi>] <hi>the</hi> Patriarch Abraham: For
when we would amplifie the honour of a perſon we put an addition of title to
his name. Or as the order of the words require, the particle <hi>even</hi> may
be referred to the tithes; and then it aggerates and amplifies the dignity of
Melchiſedec from the gift of Abraham, that Abraham gave him tithes, which is
no vulgar preſent, but a ſolemne and ſacred portion. So that the great
dignity of Melchiſedec is illuſtrated and magnified from two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as well from the perſon of Abraham, who was the Patriarch, as 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61860:63"/>from the gift of Abraham, which was a tenth of the
ſpoiles. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>the</hi> prefixed before Patriarch, doth not evince
that Abraham on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was a Patriarch, and no other men ſo: but it notes that he
was ſome principall and renowned Patriarch, as indeed he was; for he was the
father and Prince of the Patriarcks, and the firſt founder of the Jewiſh
Nation, for whoſe ſake the Jews became a Nation, becauſe they were the
ſeed which God promiſed him to be multiplyed unto him. Now from all this,
that ſo great a perſon as Abraham, the father and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Jewiſh
Nation ſhould give a tithe to Melchiſedec; from all this, I ſay, appeares
the great dignity of Melchiſedec. For he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives tithes is greater
then he that gives them: and therefore Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec muſt needs be greater
then Abraham, who yet was the greateſt of all the Jewiſh Nation; and
conſequently Melchiſedec muſt needs be greater alſo, then all the
Jewiſh Nation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And verily they that are the ſons of Levi</hi>]
He amplifies and illuſtrates his former argument; and compares Melchiſedec
with the Leviticall Prieſts in the point of taking tithes. In which
reſpect, he acknowledgeth a great dignity and prerogative in the Levites, in
that all the reſt of the tribes though deſcendants with them from the
ſame Abraham, yet were bound to pay them tithes. And ſo the dignity of
Melchiſedec far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded theirs. <hi>Who receive the office of the
Prieſthood</hi>] He ſaith not, that the ſons of Levi receive the office
of Prieſthood; but they of them who receive it. For all the Levites had not
right to the Prieſthood, but only ſome of them, namely the poſterity of
Aaron, as ye may ſee at large, Num. 3. &amp; Num. 18. The reſt of the
Levites were joyned to the Prieſts, to miniſter unto them in the holy
things, to keep the Temple and the holy veſſels, to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

need required (which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might neither touch nor look upon,
till it were wrapped up) to ſlay the ordinary ſacrifices brought by
ſingle perſons, and to performe ſuch other ſervices. <hi>Have a
commandement to take tithes of the people</hi>] This right and priviledge was
granted them from God, to claim tithes of the people: For to ſpeak properly,
the commandement to take tithes was not laid upon the Prieſts, but the people
were bound by Gods commandement to give tithes; and thereupon the Prieſts had
a right to require and exact them. <hi>According to the Law</hi>] The manner
how tithes ſhould be paid, the matter from what things, the perſons to
whom, and the times when, are all determined by Gods Law. For firſt the
people muſt give tithes to the Levites, Numb. 18 21. Then the Levites muſt
give tithes of their tithes to the Prieſts. Numb. 18.28. And herein the
dignity of the Prieſts appeares farre the greateſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not onely
the reſt of the Tribes, but alſo the Levites themſelves who were of the
ſame Tribe, gave tithes unto the Prieſts. <hi>That is their brethren though
they came out of the loynes of Abraham.</hi>] Certainly a great dignity. Which
would not have beene ſo great, if ſome other <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61860:64"/>men had
beene bound to pay them tithes; but that their owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who came as well
as they from the loynes of the ſame Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, ſhould be bound to it by the
Law of God; this was a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the dignity and eminency that
reſted in the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But hee whoſe deſcent is not counted from them,
received tithes of Abraham</hi>] He ſhews how much in this reſpect
Melchiſedec is greater then the Leviticall Prieſts, whom firſt he
deſcribed in ſuch words, as moſt elegantly agree to Chriſt his
antitype; that he might tacitely ſhew, that it nothing hindered Chriſt from
the dignity of his high Prieſthood, that he came not from the Tribe of Levi.
For it is as much as if he had ſaid, The Leviticall Prieſts have this right
and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that they take tithes of their brethren though they deſcend
from the ſame Abraham: But how much greater is it, that he, who as he comes
not from the ſame ſtock, ſo neither doth he count his kindred from them,
tooke tithes of Abraham himſelfe? For it is much more, and more worthy to
have Abraham himſelfe tributary to him, then thoſe who come from the loynes
of Abraham. Wherefore the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſts have no cauſe to boaſt, as
if to their line alone this right and priviledge were granted of taking tithes
from the people; ſeeing he who neither belongs to their line, nor accounts
himſelfe of it, did (as the Author ſpeakes) decimate Abraham himſelfe.
<hi>And bleſſed him that had the promiſes</hi>] We have ſaid before,
that the Author preferres Melchiſedec before the Leviticall Prieſts for
three reaſons; whereof the firſt is bipartite, whoſe former part the
Author hath hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and referring the latter part to the end of the
proofe, he comes here to the ſecond full reaſon, taken from the act of
Melchiſedec in bleſſing Abraham. Yet that the great dignity of
Melchiſedec might the more evidently appeare in this act of bleſſing, he
doth not name Abraham, but deſcribes him under this notion, <hi>him that had
the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, q.d.</hi> Melchiſedec bleſſed him, whom God was to
bleſſe, and had bound himſelfe by promiſe to bleſſe him, and make
him a bleſſing. For God had already ſaid unto him, <hi>I will make of
thee a great Nation, and I will bleſſe thee, and make thy name great, and
thou ſhalt be a bleſsing. And I will bleſſe them that bleſſe thee,
and curſe him that curſeth thee; and in thee ſhall all families of the
earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12.2,3. To bleſſe this man that had ſuch
promiſes of bleſſing, and thoſe ſo great, that there were none
greater knowne upon earth; and to bleſſe him alſo, not by way of charity
or good will, by praying for all happineſſe upon him; but in a ſingular
way according to his office, as he was the Miniſter and Prieſt of God; to
whoſe prayer and wiſh God would in a manner obliege himſelfe, which
certainly is an evidence of high preeminence and dignity. And from thence he
meanes to conclude that Melchiſedec was greater then Abraham.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And without all contradiction, the leſſe is
bleſſed of the greater.</hi> He <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61860:64"/>had before
expreſſed the Aſſumption, that Melchiſedec bleſſed Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and
now hee addes the Propoſition, leaving every man to frame the concluſion,
that Melchiſedec is greater then Abraham. And if hee be ſo much greater
then Abraham, much more is he greater then the Leviticall prieſts.
<hi>Without all controverſie</hi>] Theſe words ſhew that his
aſſertion is ſo evident and manifeſt; that no man can well deny it, and
that with good cauſe. For every kinde of apprecation or bleſſing, is not
here to be underſtood; for even the leaſt and meaneſt perſon may
bleſſe and pray for the beſt and greateſt, and many times doth ſo:
but as we have often noted, a ſingular and ſacerdotall bleſſing. For he
that gives another a bleſſing, as the Prieſt and eſpeciall Miniſter
of God, to whom God hath committed the right and office of it, in ſuch
manner, that God will ſecond the bleſſing of the Prieſt with his, and
in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be obliged to performe it: certainly that perſon that thus gives
the bleſſing, is greater and worthier then he that receives it. He is
greater and worthier, if not in eſtate and civill power, as if hee bleſſe
a King, when hee himſelfe is none, (which notwithſtanding had not place in
Melchiſedec) yet certainely in regard of ſacred function: For hee is nearer
in degree to God then the other, as a mean perſon between God that
bleſſeth, and the partie bleſſed; to whom he gives a kinde of right to
obtaine from God the things hee prayeth for. Therefore wee read, Numb. 6.27.
That God, after he had commanded that Aaron and his ſonnes ſhould
bleſſe the people of Iſrael, and had preſcribed alſo the forme of the
bleſſing, doth profeſſe that he will ſecond the bleſſing, and
confirme it upon the people. <hi>They ſhall</hi> (faith God) <hi>put my Name
upon the children of Iſrael, and I will bleſſe them.</hi> Hence the
ſonne of Syrach, when hee ſupplicated God for the people, and endeavoured
to move him by his prayers, he forgets not this bleſſing of Aaron,
ſaying, <hi>O Lord, heare the prayer of thy ſervants, according to the
bleſsing of Aaron over thy people.</hi>] Ecclus. 36.17.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And here men that die receive tithes</hi>] Now
followeth the third reaſon, whereby he proves that Melchiſedec is greater
then the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prieſts; namely, Becauſe the Leviticall Prieſts
receive tithes; yet one of them dies after another, and they ſucceed one
another in the Prieſt-hood: but Melchiſedec hath a teſtimony of Scripture
for him that <hi>he liveth.</hi> Here, <hi>i.</hi> here under the law and among
us. <hi>But there he of whom it is witneſſed, that he liveth.</hi>] There
where wee read that Abraham gave him tithes, he then received them, whom the
Scripture witneſſeth that he lives. But wee muſt note that the Author
oppoſeth not Melchiſedec to mortall men, but to dying men onely; neither
doth he ſay that he is immortall, but only that he liveth. For life is not
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to mortality, but properly to death. And there the Scripture
ſaith, That Melchiſedec doth live, where ſhee affirmes him to bee a
Prieſt for ever. And ſhee affirmes it in her compariſon of him with 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61860:65"/>Chriſt, when ſhe ſaith, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for
ever, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec,</hi> Pſal. 110.4. as we explicated
it before in this Chapter, verſ. 3. Where we ſhewed that Melchiſedec was
called a Prieſt for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he exerciſed his Prieſt-hood a long
time, even for the full terme of his naturall life; and that he lived ſo long
a Prieſt, as there was any knowledge of the true God among the men of his
time, and any place for the Prieſt-hood; ſo that Melchiſedec in his
Prieſt-hood, reſembled for his continuance all the Leviticall Prieſts,
who ſucceeded one after another; which eternity of his was but umbratilous
and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative (as we ſaid) of Chriſts eternitie. And therefore the life
of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec was nothing but a ſhadow of that life which is in Chriſt.
And if we reſpect the ſcope of the Authour, it makes not to the matter,
that Melchiſedec did at laſt yeeld to the law of nature and die; for he
ſpeaks not of Melchiſedec for himſelfe, but for Chriſt, who truely
lives for ever. It ſufficeth in Melchiſedec, that the eternall life of
Chriſt was in ſome manner ſhadowed, and ſignified in the Scripture. And
this is the reaſon why the Authour oppoſed Melchiſedec to dying men, and
ſaid he liveth for ever. For when wee ſpeake of the type, as of the
anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, we many times ſo ſpeak of it, as of the anti-type it ſelfe:
although the words muſt be applyed figuratively to the type, and properly to
the antitype.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And as I may ſo ſay, Levi alſo who receiveth
tithes, payed tithes (or was decimated) in Abraham.</hi> Here at laſt comes
in, the other of the firſt reaſon, which we ſaid was bipartite; and
wherewith the Author now confirmes the dignity of Melchiſedec; namely, that
when Melchiſedec tooke tithes of Abraham, he tithed alſo Levi, and all the
Prieſts ſprung from his loynes, who were themſelves to receive tithes. To
ſhew the great dignity of Melchiſedec, it was not enough for the Author to
ſay, that he tithed Abraham himſelfe, but Levi alſo, who tooke tithes,
was by him tithed in Abraham; For it is as much as if hee had taken tithes of
Levi, when he tooke them of him, in whoſe loynes Levi was yet latent.
Therefore in a figurative way of ſpeech the Author ſaith, that Levi was
tithed through Abraham. For becauſe he could not ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, that Levi
gave tithes to Melchiſedec through Abraham, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſt his words
ſhould ſeem harſh, he mollifies them thus, <hi>(as I may ſo ſay)</hi>
whereby hee plainely declares, that what hee ſpake here of Levi, muſt not
bee taken literally and properly, but in a certaine ſence and forme of
ſpeech. <hi>Levi alſo who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth tithes</hi>] not in his owne perſon,
but in his poſteritie; ſo that it is not ſtrange, that hee is ſaid to
have given tithes in his father, who is alſo ſaid to have taken them in his
children. But now let us ſee, how the Author proves this.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>For hee was yet in the loynes of his father when
Melchiſedec met him</hi>] Here he proves that Levi gave tithes to
Melchiſedec through <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61860:65"/>Abraham, thus. If at that time Levi
had been a perſon ſevered from Abraham and had enjoyed his eſtate apart
to himſelfe, this fact of Abraham in giving tithes to Melchiſedec had
nothing concerned him. But becauſe Levi was then ſo united and joyned with
Abraham, that he yet lay couched in Abrahams loyns; therefore he alſo is
juſtly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have given tithes to Melchiſedec in or through
Abraham. Which ſentence notwithſtanding muſt not be transferred to all
the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a father; but only to thoſe which properly conſiſt either
in the increaſe or decreaſe of his eſtate, which uſeth to deſcend to
his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by right of inheritance; and the payment of tithes is ſuch an
action, for it ſo much decreaſeth the fathers eſtate. For they are paid
out of the fathers goods, which thus farre are already the childrens, in that
the right of inheritance thereto belongs to them; eſpecially if it be
certaine that the father hath or may have children to ſucceed him in his
eſtate, as Abraham had, to whom God had for certaine promiſed a
poſterity. For as the heire after his fathers death doth in a manner
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the perſon of his father, by his ſucceeding to him and
poſſeſſing his eſtate: ſo likewiſe the father before his children
be ſevered from him and have a right to diſpoſe of his goods as their
own, doth in a manner alſo repreſent the perſon of his heire and of all
the reſt of his children: and what he then ordereth or doth in his goods, the
ſame in a manner his heires are accounted to doe. I ſay <hi>in a
manner,</hi> becauſe properly this cannot be ſaid, neither doth the Author
himſelfe ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, that it was done, but acknowledgeth an impropriety
in his words as we noted before. Hence may eaſily be underſtood that which
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Author we affirme; that ſuch acts of the parents muſt be
extended only to thoſe of their ſucceſſors or poſterity, to whom the
inheritance or ſome notable portion of their goods ſhall deſcend, either
for certainty as here to Abrahams poſterity, or at leaſt in all
probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For otherwiſe that force of inheritance whereof we ſpeake,
will expire; and what any man orders concerning his eſtate cannot be
attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his children and poſterity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>If therefore perfection</hi>] After that by
comparing Melchiſedec with the Leviticall Prieſts, hee had ſhewed that
Melchiſedec was a Prieſt, and a Prieſt much differing from the
Leviticall, as a perſon farre greater and worthier then they. Now he proceeds
to the third part of the Chapter. And in regard that after thoſe Leviticall
Prieſts, there muſt be another Prieſt ordained according to the order of
Melchiſedec and not according to the order of Aaron; therefore he thence
argues and proves the imperfection of the Leviticall Prieſthood, and alſo
of the Law it ſelfe, upon which that Prieſthood was ordained; and upon the
imperfection of that Prieſthood and Law, he proves the abrogation of both.
<hi>If perfection were by the Leviticall Prieſthood</hi>] By perfection here
he underſtands nothing elſe, but a true and perfect expiation of 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61860:66"/>ſinne, whereby the guilt not of ſome ſinnes only but
of all, even of the moſt grievous offences and crimes is taken away; whereby
all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſinne not only temporall concerning this life, but the
eternall puniſhment of death it ſelfe is remitted and forgiven; whereby a
right to eternall life is granted unto men: and laſtly, whereby not only all
guilt of all ſinnes, but all ſinnes themſelves are taken away from men.
For in theſe things conſiſteth the true perfection of men before God. If
therefore this perfection could have been brought to men by the Leviticall
Prieſthood, certainly there had been no need nor uſe of a new Prieſthood
after the order of Melchiſedec; for every Prieſthood is ordained for the
expiation of ſinnes. But if a perfect expiation of ſinnes could have been
effected by the Prieſthood after the order of Aaron, what need a new Prieſt
bee ſuper induced after the order of Melchiſedec, to performe thoſe
actions which might have been done by the former? Wherefore ſeeing God would
ordaine a new Prieſt, and alſo now hath ordained him; hence it appears,
that by the Leviticall Prieſthood, no man could obtaine perfection or perfect
expiation, and certainly no man did obtaine it. For by that Prieſthood ſome
ſinnes only were expiated; namely, as we ſhewed before, ignorances and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: but great offences as crimes and villanies were puniſhed with
death. Neither had that expiation any force to take away eternall death, but
only to releaſe ſome temporall puniſhments proper to this life. Neither
in thoſe ſacrifices was there any power to withdraw men from ſinne it
ſelfe; all which particulars the Author proſecutes in the paſſages
following. Yet the Author uſeth not the word <hi>perfection</hi> in one
ſenſe only, for there are divers perfections of a thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we
muſt ſtill gather from the matter handled what perfection hee meanes. Here
becauſe hee ſpeaks of perfection flowing from the Prieſthood, therefore
no other can be underſtood but that which is ſeen in a perfect expiation of
ſinne; namely, that a man bee wholly ſpotleſſe and blameleſſe,
ſubject neither to paine nor loſſe by any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation in
the ſight of God. In which ſenſe he uſeth the ſame word, chap. 10.
14. <hi>For under it the people received the Law</hi>] For what purpoſe the
Author inſerted theſe words into his former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we ſhall ſee
afterward; and for the preſent ſhall ſpeake of their explication. Under
it, <hi>i.</hi> under the Prieſthood, as if the people had received the Law
under the Prieſthood; and ſo moſt Interpreters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. But this
ſenſe is contrary to the words in the originall, which are
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and doe not ſignifie
<hi>under</hi> it, but <hi>upon</hi> it; and contrary to the truth of the
thing; for the Law was not given under the Prieſthood as if the Prieſthood
had been extant before the Law given; but rather contrarily a great and
principall part of the Law was already given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prieſthood was
ordained; ſo that it might be more truly ſaid, the Prieſthood was given
under or after the Law, then the Law under <pb n="127" facs="tcp:61860:66"/>or after the
Prieſthood. And laſtly, this ſenſe is contrary to the mind of the
Author, and makes nothing to the purpoſe: For what makes it to the purpoſe
in hand, that the Law was given in the time of the Prieſthood? For would it
thence follow, either that perfection muſt be by that Prieſthood; or if
perfection were by it, that there were no need of another Prieſthood? or
laſtly, if the Prieſthood were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, that then the Law were abrogate?
Wherefore as the Greeke words ſound, it is ſaid in this place, that the
people received the Law not <hi>under</hi> the Prieſthood, but <hi>upon</hi>
the Prieſthood. And to receive the Law <hi>upon</hi> the Prieſthood, is
nothing elſe but <hi>of</hi> the Prieſthood, concerning or touching it.
Which ſenſe ſome Interpreters doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as Junius and Tremellius
and Piſcator. For the Greeke particle
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> anſwers the Hebrew
<hi>Hal;</hi> which often notes the object or matter of a thing. Now therefore
theſe words may ſeem to cohere with the minde of the Author three wayes. 1.
If we ſay, that in them he ſhews the cauſe, why he named the Leviticall
prieſthood and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>q.d.</hi> therefore I name the Leviticall
prieſthood, becauſe the people received the Law of it. 2. That in them he
ſhews cauſe, why it might ſeem, that perfection came by that
Prieſthood; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people received the Law of it. 3. That
thoſe words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a confirmation or peculiar reaſon, why if perfection
came not by the Leviticall prieſthood, there muſt not be another Prieſt
ordained di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from the Leviticall. For though this would bee ſufficient
of it ſelf to exclude another Prieſt; yet it follows ſo much the more, if
not only perfection be by the Leviticall Prieſthood, but alſo that
Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was eſtabliſhed by the Law: and of this reaſon wee moſt
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Therefore it is as much as if the Author had ſaid, If perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be by the Leviticall Prieſthood, eſpecially ſeeing concerning it, Laws
were given to the people; what need is there, for the ordination of another
Prieſt? for many times in Scripture a reaſon of a ſentence is inſerted,
before the ſentence bee fully uttered in all the parts of it. Whereof among
other places we have an example, 1 Pet. 4.1.2. in theſe words, <hi>For he
that hath ſuffered in the fleſh hath ceaſed from ſin,</hi> which muſt
be read as in a parentheſis. For they containe the cauſe, why Chriſtians
muſt ſuffer in the fleſh with Chriſt; <hi>i.</hi> crucifie the fleſh,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that hath ſuffered in the fleſh; <hi>i.</hi> whoſe body is
put to death, he hath ceaſed from ſinne. And the reaſon is generall,
agreeing to all the dead. Therefore the words which follow from the beginning
of the ſecond verſe, That he no longer ſhould live, &amp;c muſt not be
joyned with the words next preceding, Ceaſed from ſinne; but (they being
included in a parentheſis as a generall reaſon) they muſt be referred to
the former words, arm your ſelves, as to their finall cauſe. The mind of
the Author in this place will be more plain, if we transfer theſe words, to
the end of the verſe, thus. Therefore if perfection be by the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61860:67"/>Prieſthood; what further need was there that another
Prieſt ſhould riſe after the order of Melchiſedec, and not be called
after the order of Aaron; eſpecially ſeeing of that Prieſthood the Law
was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the people? For thence it preſently followes, that together
with this Prieſthood the Law muſt be abrogated, when a Prieſt ordained
according to the order of Melchiſedec; which ſhould not be abrogated
unleſſe there were ſome default in it. <hi>That another Prieſt ſhould
riſe</hi>] From his former grounds he inferres, that a Prieſt after the
order of Melchiſedec, muſt be another and a different Prieſt from thoſe
Prieſts that are after the order of Aaron. For Melchiſedec was both a King
and a Prieſt; the Levites were onely Prieſts; he had no Prieſtly
pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, theſe muſt have ſo; he had neither predeceſſor nor
ſucceſſor: theſe ſucceed one another; he is an eternall Prieſt;
theſe dye: laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is greater and worthier then Abraham himſelfe, and
therefore much more ſo then the Leviticall Prieſts. <hi>After the order of
Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>] The order of Melchiſedec is a little otherwiſe taken
then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Aaron: for by that is ſignified a likeneſſe onely with
the Prieſt Melchiſedec, as the Author ſpeakes afterward, ver. 15. but in
this is contained not onely a likeneſſe with Aaron, but alſo a naturall
ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into his place and Prieſthood.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>For the Prieſthood being changed, there is made
of neceſsity a change alſo of the Law</hi>] He brings a reaſon, (which
notwithſtanding was before tacitely ſhewed in the parentheſis which we
explicated) why a Prieſt muſt be ordained according to Aaron, and no other
riſe according to the order of Melchiſedec, if by the Aaronicall
Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood mens ſins could have beene expiated perfectly. The reaſon is,
becauſe the Prieſthood could not be abrogated or changed, unleſſe the
Law whereby it was eſtabliſhed were abrogated and changed alſo Wherefore
either to preſerve the authority of the Law it ſelfe, if not for the
dignity of the Leviticall Prieſthood, a Prieſt muſt have beene ordained
after the order of Aaron, if perfection came by that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But
becauſe this was not done, therefore it is manifeſt that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection could
not be given by that Prieſthood; and conſequently for the imperfection of
it, there was good cauſe it ſhould expire. He ſaith the Prieſthood was
changed, not onely for that it was tranſlated to another Tribe (diverſe
from that of Levi) wherein a Prieſt was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained after the order of
Melchiſedec: but alſo in that the Prieſthood it ſelfe was altered and
changed into another kinde different from the former. Although to the end the
Author might uſe this word in this latter ſenſe for altered, therefore
from the former ſenſe of changing the Tribe he might take occaſion
conſequently to uſe it of the Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſignifie the abrogation of
the Law. For hence afterward at the eighteenth verſe, when he ſpeakes of
the Law alone, inſtead of the word changed, he puts diſanulling, or
abrogating. And the abrogation <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61860:67"/>of the Law, though in this
place it properly be referred to that part of the Law, whereby the Aaronicall
Prieſthood was eſtabliſhed, yet we muſt know, that upon the abrogation
of that Sacerdotall Law, all the force and authority of the Law of Moſes was
diſanulled alſo, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning externall rites and ceremonies.
For together with the Prieſthood, not ſome one Law fell alone, but many
Lawes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rites fell with it; neither is there any cauſe to thinke,
but that upon the expiring of ſo many Lawes, all the reſt of the ſame
kinde and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture died alſo. And beſides, upon the abrogation of one
Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Moſes Law, is not that bond of the Law diſſolved, which
layes a curſe upon him, that continues not in all things that are written in
the booke of the Law: but upon the diſſolution of this bond, the whole
frame of the Law muſt needs fall aſunder. For from that bond it appeares
that it was the minde of the Law-maker, that all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or commandements
of that Law ſhould either ſtand together, or by the fall of one, the
authority of the whole Law ſhould faile.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>For he of whom theſe things are ſpoken</hi>]
Here the Author proves, that the Prieſthood being changed, or another
Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec being ordained, the Law thereupon
muſt needs bee changed or abrogated. The reaſon is, becauſe the perſon
deſigned by theſe words <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of
Melchiſedec</hi>] deſcended not from Levi, but from another Tribe; out of
which no perſon deſcending might lawfully approach to the Altar, to offer
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as a Prieſt. But the Law which ordained the Prieſthood of
Aaron, did expreſly provide, that no man not of the Tribe of Levi, and no man
of that Tribe not of the family of Aaron, ſhould exerciſe the Prieſthood.
Whence it is manifeſt, that a Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec could
not be ordained, unleſſe the Law were violated. <hi>Pertaining to another
Tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>] Attendance at the
Altar, is the performance of the Ceremonies, by officiating at the Sacrifices,
and ordering thoſe things that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Altar &amp; to ſuch
other ſervices. And attendance here muſt not be taken for the act of doing
it, but for the right to do it: for it is wel knowne, that ſome Kings did
dare <hi>de facto</hi> to approach unto the Altar &amp; burn Incenſe there,
but by uſurpation, and without any right to do it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>For it is evident our Lord ſprang out of Iudah,
of which Tribe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpake nothing concerning Prieſthood</hi>] Here he
confirmes his former reaſon, that Chriſt our Lord of whom theſe words
were ſpoken, that he was a Prieſt for ever after the order of
Melchiſedec, pertained to a Tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the
Altar, or performed the office of Prieſthood. The reaſon is, becauſe it
is evident that he ſprang out of Judah, of which Tribe Moſes ſpake
nothing concerning the Prieſthood; and therefore by the Law had no right to
the Prieſthood; for this followes upon the former. And the Author 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61860:68"/>takes it for granted, that he of whom the words of the
Pſalme are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is our Lord Chriſt the annointed of God. That
Chriſt ſprang out of the Tribe of Judah, he ſaith it is evident,
<hi>i.</hi> generally knowne to all men; for no man was ignorant that Chriſt
came from the line of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. And he had good reaſon to take this for
granted, becauſe theſe words of the Pſalme, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for
ever</hi>] are ſpoken of him, whom David in the beginning of that Pſalme
calleth his Lord, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him in the ſpirit: but he that is the Lord
of David, muſt needs be our Lord alſo; who ſeeing he is mentioned of the
Lord Jehovah, or the moſt high and onely God, as a diſtinct perſon to
whom the words were ſpoken, from him that ſpake them, Sit thou at my right
hand, and Thou art a Prieſt for ever, certainely he can be no other then
Chriſt our Lord the anointed of God. For that this was acknowledged of the
Maſters and Doctors among the Jewes, it is manifeſt from hence, that
Chriſt diſputing with the Phariſees, ſuppoſeth it, as a thing no way
doubtfull but confeſſed of all, when he demanded of them, How Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid could
call Chriſt his Lord, ſeeing as they had anſwered him, he was his ſon.
For unleſſe they had all acknowledged it, the anſwer had beene eaſie to
ſay, that Chriſt was neither that Lord, nor ſo called of David. The
Author alſo ſuppoſeth it for granted, that our Lord Chriſt ſprang
from the Tribe of Judah; becauſe he wrote to them who were already
perſwaded that Jeſus of Nazareth was Chriſt. And Chriſt, though he was
conceived by the holy Ghoſt, without the act of any man, yet is ſaid to
ſpring from Abraham, from Judah, and from David; becauſe he was borne of
Mary the wife of Joſeph, who was of the poſterity of David, of Judah, and
of Abraham. For any ſon, that is borne of a mans wife, which is accounted her
husbands body, though it be not begotten by the husband, ſo it be not
begotten by any other man, is his ſon who is husband to the woman. For God
hath free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to give a man a ſon any way, whether naturally by the
husband, or ſupernaturally without the husband. For by the Law of God it was
ordained of old, that when the husband died without iſſue, his brother if
he have any, ſhould marry the widow, and as ſoone as he had any childe by
her, it ſhould be called the ſeed of her husband that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. With
how much more reaſon may Chriſt juſtly be called the ſon of Joſeph,
and therefore of David, Judah, or Abraham? becauſe, though he were not
begotten by Joſeph himſelfe; yet he was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his life time, not by
the act of any other man ſupplying the part of Joſeph, but by the worke and
power of the holy Ghoſt; and by him begotten upon Mary the eſpouſed wife
of Joſeph. The points by ſome diſputed on this place; whether Chriſt by
his mothers ſide were not of the Tribe of Levi? are doubtfull in
themſelves, and impertinent to the matter. For among the Jews, no man was
referred to any Tribe, but by his father. Hence in all the genealogies or
pedigrees men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61860:68"/>in Scripture, men onely are named:
but the genealogies of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are never deſcribed, or no otherwiſe but by
the men, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie of Iudith, chap. 8. But if in any genealogie a
woman be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, her parents are not inſerted, as Matth. 1. Boos begat
Obed of Ruth; Judas begat Pharez of Thamar. David begate Solomon, of her that
had been the wife of Vrias. The reaſon is, becauſe it mattered not for the
tribe or pedigree of what woman the childe were borne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one or
other. For the father alwayes gave the tribe and family to the childe.
Wherefore the genealogie of Chriſt, whether by Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, or Luke, is not
framed from the anceſtors of Mary but of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And it is yet more evident, for that after the
ſimilitude of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec, there ariſeth another Prieſt.</hi>] By
another argument taken from the nature of the Prieſthood, he ſhews, that by
the riſing of another Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec, the Law is
abrogated. <hi>q. d.</hi> If it be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as it is, that upon the
tranſlation of the Prieſthood to another tribe or family, contrary to the
precept of the Law, the Law it ſelfe is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abrogated: much more is the
abrogation of it evident, upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of another Prieſt after the
order of Melchiſedec. If the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had been onely tranſlated to
another tribe or family, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former qualitie of it, without
any other alteration, certainly leſſe violence had been done to the Law:
but ſeeing the Prieſthood is tranſlated into another family and tribe,
upon which the Law no way ſetled it; and alſo altered into a new kinde of
Prieſthood; much more is it evident, that by this tranſlation and
alteration of the Prieſthood, the Law it ſelfe is changed and abrogated.
<hi>After the ſimilitude of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec, there ariſeth another
Prieſt.</hi>] Another Prieſt, notlike Aaron, to be either of his family, or
of his continuance: but like Melchiſedec, to continue a Prieſt for
ever.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Who is made not after the Law of a carnall
commandment: but after the power of an endleſſe life.</hi>] The Prieſt
after the ſimilitude or likeneſſe of Melchiſedec, is not like the
Prieſts after Aarons order, who are made after the Law of a carnall
commandment; neither is hee a temporary Prieſt to live for a time onely as
they did: but an eternall Prieſt for ever. <hi>After the Law of a carnall
commandment.</hi> By Law of commandment, he meanes thoſe particular precepts
in the Law, for the election and ordination of the Prieſt, which are called
carnall, becauſe they had reſpect onely to the fleſh, and conſidered
onely the linage, birth, and death of the Prieſt; binding the Prieſthood to
a certain tribe, namely, of Levi, and to a certain family in that tribe,
namely, of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: and providing for the mortalitie of the Prieſt, by
determining the rights of ſucceſſion; all which conſiderations are
carnall, reſpecting onely the fleſh. For the Law commanded that upon the
death of one Prieſt, another ſhould ſucceed him; to the end, that though
the Prieſts <pb n="132" facs="tcp:61860:69"/>dyed, yet the Prieſthood might not die.
According to this carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment or Lawes reſpecting the fleſh, that
Prieſt was not to bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, who was to be made after the order of
Melchiſedec: For hee had neither predeceſſour nor ſucceſſour,
neither came hee from the family of Aaron. The particle <hi>after</hi> doth
here note the manner of the Prieſthood, for the conſtitution of it, as
applyed to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule or Law; for though the word ſometime
ſignifie otherwiſe, yet this is the moſt uſuall ſence of it. So that
here is propoſed unto us, the qualitie of that Prieſt, who is after the
likeneſſe of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec, and a qualitie contrary to the qualitie of the
Prieſts after Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons order; becauſe as we have often noted, every
Aaronicall Prieſt was but temporary onely for a time: but the Prieſt after
Melchiſedecs order is perpetuall and eternall for ever. The words following
do en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>force this ſence, eſpecially if wee regard the proofe contained in
the verſe following. <hi>But after the power of an endleſſe life</hi>]
The Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Melchiſedees order, is ſuch a one, as hath the power of
perpetuitie, ſuch as an endleſſe life requires to be. Hee is not a
carnall, mortall, and frail Prieſt, that after a little time ſhould need a
ſucceſſour: but a moſt potent Prieſt that hath an abſolute power;
an eternall Prieſt that hath an endleſſe life: For to this ſence, that
which followes doth excellently agree.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>For hee teſtifieth, Thou art a Prieſt for
ever, after the order of Melchiſedec. q.d.</hi> Therefore I ſay, that the
Prieſt after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec is an eternall Prieſt, becauſe
God openly teſtifies it, when hee ſaith, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after
the order of Melchiſedec.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>For there is verily a diſanulling of the
commandement going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>] He had ſaid before, that if the
Prieſthood were changed, then the Law alſo muſt be changed; and hitherto
he hath proved that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Now he ſhewes the reaſon why the Law
muſt be antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, changed or abrogated: For hee ſeemes to looke backward
to the principall purpoſe, and the ſcope of the former words, partly
expreſſed, verſe 12. and in a manner repeated, verſe 15. and ſo
againe, verſe 16. where hee ſaith, that Chriſt is not made a Prieſt
according to the Law of a carnall commandment. In which words he ſhewed, that
the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Law for ordaining of the Prieſt, was neglected in
Chriſt, and therefore abrogated. Therefore now leſt any man ſhould
marvell at this; hee ſhewes the reaſon why the Law was juſtly abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>For the weakneſſe and unprofitableneſſe thereof.</hi>] This is the
cauſe why the Law was abrogate, becauſe it was weake and unprofitable. For
all Lawes uſe to be abrogated and diſanulled, when by experience they are
found to be ineffectuall, weake, and unprofitable; for wiſe men have found
out no other cauſes, why Lawes ſhould bee diſanulled and repealed. Now
the infirmitie of a Law appears in this, that it cannot performe the matter for
which it was ordained: which infirmitie or <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61860:69"/>wickedneſſe
of the Law, he either explicates or amplifies by the word unprofitable; for the
weakenes of a Law makes it uſeleſſe.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>For the Law made nothing perfect.</hi>] Here hee
proves that the Law is weake and unprofitable; whereof he gives this reaſon;
becauſe it made nothing perfect. <hi>i.</hi> it contained no perfect
expiation for ſinne, as wee heard before, verſe 11. and ſhall heare it
againe, Chapter 10. verſe 1.14. Now perfect expiation conſiſteth in a
totall taking away all guilt of all ſinnes, and of all puniſhments, not
onely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall but eternall. Such an expiation the Law conferred upon no man.
For if (as wee ſaw at the 11. verſe) the Prieſthood could not do this;
how could the Law doe it, ſeeing the Law could doe nothing this way, but by
vertue of the Prieſthood? The Law did condemne men, but not juſtifie them;
it granted expiation to ſome ſmall ſinnes, and that only in regard of
temporall puniſhment; but for heynous offences, upon which it ordained the
puniſhment of death, it left no pardon; but laid a curſe upon all, that
offended highly. In this perfect expiation, is contained antecedently, as I may
ſay, an obduction from ſinne. For perfect expiation comes to us upon that
condition, as we ſhall ſee, by the oppoſition following. <hi>Made nothing
perfect</hi>] Nothing here is put for no man, the neuter gender for the
maſculine; and ſo likewiſe at the ſeventh verſe. If therefore the Law
could bring perfect expiation and juſtification to no man, it is juſtly
ſaid to be weake and unprofitable; namely, in regard it could not produce the
true and perfect good of men. <hi>But the bringing in of a better hope
did</hi>] <hi>q.d.</hi> The Law perfected no man: but the ſuperinduction of a
better hope doth perfect men; for here is an illuſtration from the contrary.
By a better hope, hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the hope of eternall life, joyned with a
plenary remiſſion of all ſinnes, granted from God to all penitent
perſons; without which remiſſion, the promiſe of eternall life made to
mankinde, had beene ineffectuall and unprofitable; ſeeing we have all
ſinned, and thereby made our ſelves unworthy of eternall life. Therefore
the Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing afterward the new Covenant in the words of the
Prophet, and ſhewing that it is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,
mentions only the remiſſion of ſinnes granted in the new Covenant. And by
the new Covenant or Goſpel, and the Prieſthood of Chriſt adjoyned to it,
this better hope is ſuperinduced upon the Law. For the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant brings a
better hope, becauſe it is eſtabliſhed upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but not
without the Prieſthood of Chriſt, which doth not only confirme and
eſtabliſh the promiſes of the Covenant, but doth alſo perfect and
performe them. For the perfect remiſſion of our ſinnes depends upon
Chriſts Prieſthood; and therefore the Prieſthood of Chriſt ſpoken of
in this place, muſt here be joyned with the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; as alſo the old
Prieſthood and ſacrifices muſt be joyned with the Law. Therefore the
ſuperinduction or bringing in of a better <pb n="134" facs="tcp:61860:70"/>hope, that is,
the new Covenant containing the Prieſthood of Chriſt, which gives us an
aſſured hope of eternall life, and of perfect forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all our
ſins, doth moſt perfectly expiate men, and purge them from all guilt of all
ſinne. <hi>By the which we draw nigh unto God.</hi>] Here he gives a reaſon
why this hope is better and doth perfect us, becauſe it makes us to approah
and come neare unto God, by ſuing for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by ſerving him with all
our heart, and obeying him in all things commanded us. For he that hath this
hope in God, purifieth himſelfe even as he is pure, 1 John 3.3. And becauſe
we approach unto God, therefore reciprocally God alſo approacheth and draweth
nigh unto us, <hi>i.</hi> doth embrace us with a ſtrict bond of love, that
ſo being purged from all ſinne, hee may deliver us from eternall death, and
inveſt us' with eternall life. Hence ſaith St. James. Draw nigh unto God,
and he will draw nigh unto you, Jam. 4.8. The Law therefore becauſe it wanted
this hope, could not make us draw nigh unto God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not
doe that, therefore it could not make us partake of a perfect expiation. For
our approach unto God, is the way to perfect expiation; ſeeing while we
approach unto God, we caſt off ſinne and live godly: and while God
approacheth unto us, we are thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly expiated and juſtified. As
therefore this bringing in of a better hope, makes us approach unto God, ſo
far it juſtifies us: Which the Law could not doe, but for the rigor of it,
whereby it excludes peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from a full remiſſion of ſins: and alſo
for default of any open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternall life, which miniſters unto men
great power and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for obedience unto God.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>And in as much as not without an oath, he was
made Prieſt</hi>] After the Author had ſhewed that by the Prieſthood of
Chriſt, the Law was abrogated, and added the cauſe of that abrogation, and
taught that in the room thereof there ſucceeded a far more excellent
Covenant, that maketh us approach unto God. Now by a new argument hee ſhews
how much Chriſt our Prieſt is greater then the legall Prieſts, and how
far the new Covenant excels the old. And he draws his argument from hence, that
Chriſt was made a Prieſt with an oath; but the old legall Prieſts without
an oath: from whence it plainly appeares, that Chriſt is better then they.
For an oath declares the truth and the ſtrength of a thing. Now the things
that God will have to be firme, ſtrong, and unchangeable, muſt needs bee
better then thoſe things which have not that firmity and ſtrength; ſuch
as are the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no oath is added, but God will have them to depend
upon his will and pleaſure; that he may either remove or retaine them, as it
ſhall ſeem good unto him. And beſides, looke how much better the Prieſt
is, ſo much is the Covenant better. For the Prieſthood takes all the
dignity and excellency of it, from the Covenant of God; and by the Prieſthood
the effect of the Covenant is performed. And therefore <pb n="135" facs="tcp:61860:70"/>from hence that Chriſt was made a Prieſt by oath, by ſo much hee
was made a ſurety of a better teſtament, as the Author rightly collects it,
ver. 22. that is, by how much Chriſt, who was ordained with Gods oath, is
better then the Prieſt who was ordained without an oath: by ſo much is the
new Covenant better then the old.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>For thoſe Prieſts were made without an oath;
but this with an oath</hi>] This whole verſe muſt be read in a
parentheſis, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines an oppoſition between the old
Prieſts and Chriſt; in as much as they were made Prieſts without any oath
of God, but Chriſt with an oath. <hi>By him that ſaid unto him</hi>] namely
by him that ſaid thoſe words unto him, Thou art a Prieſt for ever,
&amp;c. And by him that ſaid thoſe words to Chriſt, God himſelf ſeems
to be underſtood, although the words next cited, <hi>The Lord ſware and
will not repent him</hi>] ſeeme not to be the words of God himſelf, but of
the Prophet, who relates this oath of God. But becauſe the words following,
<hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever</hi>] are the words of God; therefore by him
that ſaid unto him, the Author might well meane God. For although in theſe
words, there bee no oath of God expreſſed; yet it is as much as if it had
been expreſſed, ſeeing the Prophet teſtifies, that God uttering theſe
words did ſwear, which therefore the Author would not omit, though he were to
relate the words of God himſelfe and not of the Prophet. But if by him who
ſaid theſe words unto Chriſt, we underſtand not God but the Prophet, as
ſome Interpreters upon that Pſalme do, who ſo expound theſe words, as
if the Pſalmiſt had ſaid, The Lord ſware, &amp;c. Thou art a Prieſt
for ever, then the Prophet muſt be meant, by a common forme of ſpeech, that
Chriſt was made Prieſt by the Prophet, becauſe the Prophet by theſe
words did foretell and declare that he ſhould bee made Prieſt. For many
times in Scripture the declaring of a thing is ſaid to be the doing of it. In
this ſenſe Jeremy is ſaid to have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to root out and to
deſtroy, to build and to plant, Jer. 1.10. So the Prophet Eſay is ſaid,
to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael,
and to be given for a light to the Gentiles, becauſe he propheſied and
foretold of theſe things. <hi>The Lord ſware and will not repent</hi>] this
oath argues that the matter of it was great, certain and unchangeable; and
becauſe God will not repent it, therefore it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and acceptable to
God. So that the thing muſt not be altered or undone, both in regard of the
oath and of the goodneſſe of it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by not repenting we conceive
the ſetled conſtancie of God, never to revoke or alter the matter. For
repentance attributed to God, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies only a change of the fact: by way of
reſemblance from men, who if they repent, doe commonly alter the thing, if it
lye in their power.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>By ſo much was Ieſus made the ſurety of a
better teſtament</hi>] Theſe words are cleerely anſwerable to the
beginning of the 20. verſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61860:71"/>by the
particles of relation there and here, <hi>in as much,</hi> and <hi>by ſo
much.</hi> Jeſus is called the ſurety of the Covenant or Teſtament,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he contracted it with us in the Name of God, and ratified it on Gods
part, making faith of it unto us, that God would keepe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of his
Covenant. Not therefore, as if he became our ſurety to God, and tooke upon
him the payment of our debts. For, we ſent not Chriſt unto God is our name,
but God ſent him to us in his Name. And Chriſt came to us from God, made a
Covenant with us, became ſurety for the promiſes of it, and undertooke they
ſhould be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And therefore he is not called a Surety ſimply, but
the Surety of the Covenant. And he undertooke for the truth of Gods Covenant
diverſe wayes, as by his perpetuall teſtimony in words for the force and
ſtrength of it, by proving the faith of his function in it in many
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments; by his perfect innocency and holineſſe of life, by ſeverall
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine workes and miracles which he wrought, by ſuffering a grievous death,
to aſſert the truth of his doctrine. Hence his Apoſtle John pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
thoſe three witneſſes of undoubted faith, to confirme the truth of
Chriſtian Religion; namely, the Spirit, water and bloud, 1 John 5.8. Where by
Spirit he underſtands that divine power in Chriſt, which he ſhewed in his
admirable workes; by water, the blameleſſe and ſpotleſſe life of
Chriſt; and by bloud, his bloudy death. For Chriſtian truth approves it
ſelfe by ſuch witneſſes. That divine Spirit, teſtified by ſo many
wondrous workes, doth it not evidently declare, that Chriſt was a divine man,
ſent from God; and therefore that he preached nothing forged of himſelfe,
but onely that which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the God of truth? Would that God who
is moſt holy repleniſh an impoſtor with ſuch &amp; ſo great gifts of
his Spirit? The moſt pure and holy life of Chriſt, is it not an open
teſtimony, that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected no earthly thing, that he ſought no
worldly wealth, no honors nor pleaſures? but had repoſed all his hopes in
God, and in thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly goods which he promiſed unto others. From
whence otherwiſe could ſo great holineſſe of life proceed, and ſo
great contempt of all worldly things? For Impoſtors uſe not to truſt in
God, and to expect from him the rewards of heaven. Impoſtors uſe not to
paſſe their life in ſuch holineſſe &amp; abſtinence from all ſin.
For why do they labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude men with their impoſtures and deceits? Do
they it only to deceive without any advantage to themſelves, and to expoſe
themſelves to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diverſe dangers and troubles, which commonly
accompany ſuch impoſtures, and making themſelves guilty of this one
thankleſſe wickedneſſe, to follow piety in all things elſe?
certainely nothing leſſe. Such kinde of perſons ſeeke their owne
commodity, to gaine wealth, to get a vaine glorious name, and to abound in
pleaſure; which whoſo aymes at, cannot leade a life innocent and void of
all blame. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Impoſtors or falſe teachers
doth juſtly <pb n="137" facs="tcp:61860:71"/>affirme, that they have their belly for
their god, and minde earthly things; that they are enemies to the Croſſe of
Chriſt, and have their conſcience ſeared with a hot iron, Phil. 3.18,19.
and 1 Tim. 4.2. And Chriſt warning his Diſciples to beware of falſe
prophets, tels them, that ſuch may be knowne by their fruits, <hi>i.</hi> by
their works, which are an infallible ſigne of their deceit. Doe men (ſaith
he) gather grapes of thornes, or figs of thiſtles? an evill tree cannot bring
forth good fruit. Mat. 7.16. For however for a time they may diſſemble and
make ſhew of godlineſſe, yet they cannot do it conſtantly. For feigned
holineſſe laſteth not long, and covert wickedneſſe lyes not long hid.
The life therefore of Chriſt being carried on in one perpetuall tenor of
inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and holineſſe, doth wholly vindicate him from the crime of any
impoſture. Hence Chriſt himſelfe contends with the Jews by this
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin? and if I ſay the truth
why do yee not beleeve me?</hi> John 8 46. <hi>q.d.</hi> Either convince me of
ſin, or if ye cannot do that, but that my innocency acquits me from all
crime, why do yee reject me as an Impoſtor and a counterfeit, and do not
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledge my doctrine for truth? Laſtly, the Bloud of Chriſt,
<hi>i.</hi> his cruell and infamous death, which he ſuffered with ſuch
conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that hee might aſſert his doctrine, and eſpecially that hee
might teſtifie himſelfe to bee Chriſt, and the Sonne of God; what
poſſible ſuſpicion can this leave of the leaſt fraud or falſhood?
For if Chriſt had beene conſcious to himſelfe of any fraud or falſhood,
would hee have caſt himſelfe upon ſo infamous and fearfull a death? and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it with ſuch patiency and conſtancy of minde? If he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to get himſelfe a name by lyes and deceits, would he have caſt himſelfe
ſo freely uponextreame reproach and diſgrace, and get fame by no other
meanes but by an infamous death? for being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Croſſe, what
could he elſe hope for, if hee were an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor? But if Chriſt were no
way conſcious to himſelfe of any fraud or falſhood, but ſuffered death
to aſſert his doctrine, who ſees not but he muſt needs be void of all
offence? For if his doctrine were falſe, it muſt needs be fained of
himſelfe. For he publiquely profeſſed, that he had ſeene the Father,
had received commands from him, and was ſent from him into the world, that he
was the Son of God, and the King of Gods people, which God had promiſed long
before. Now if theſe things were falſe, how could Chriſt be ignorant of
their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood? but if he knew them to be falſe, whence could he have
ſuch a contempt of death for the aſſerting of them? whence could he have
ſuch an invincible conſtancy and courage of minde? Seeing therefore we have
Jeſus a ſurety of the new Covenant, atteſted with ſo many documents of
the truth, ſhall we doubt to joyne our faith unto him, to reſt upon the
hope of thoſe heavenly bleſſings which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this
Covenant, to caſt off the yoke of ſin, and to give our name 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61860:72"/>up to God and his righteouſneſſe. Some man may
marvaile, why the Author treating of Chriſts Prieſthood both before and
after, ſhould ſuddenly call him the ſurety of the new Covenant, and not
the Prieſt of it? Why did hee not ſay <hi>by ſo much was Ieſus made a
Prieſt of a better Teſtament?</hi>] For the whole context of the Chapter
ſeemes to require this. It is very credible, that in the word ſurety, the
Prieſthood of Chriſt is alſo underſtood. For it is the part of a
ſurety not onely to promiſe ſomething in the name of another, and to
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his faith for another; but alſo if the cauſe require, to
performe the thing he promiſed in anothers name; and among men, there is
cauſe, if the principall performe it not, for whom the ſurety
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: but here it proceeds upon a contrary cauſe, (for the former
cannot here take place) namely, becauſe he for whom Chriſt interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as
a ſurety, doth performe his promiſes to us by Chriſt himſelfe; in which
action the Prieſthood of Chriſt doth chiefly conſiſt. For Chriſt as
he is a Prieſt, doth now in heaven nothing more intentively, then to performe
Gods promiſes unto us, <hi>i.</hi> he takes away all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our
ſins, he endowes us with Gods gifts and graces, and at laſt tranſlates us
into heaven.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>And they truly were many Prieſts, becauſe
they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death.</hi>] Here he brings
a new difference betweene Chriſt a Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec,
and the Prieſts after Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons order; and withall proves him far more
excellent then they. And this difference is, that they were many, but Chriſt
was but one himſelf onely. The reaſon of both is taken from the 16. and 17.
verſes, becauſe they were mortall, and one being dead, another muſt
ſucceed; but Chriſt is immortall and lives for ever.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>But this man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath
an unchangeable Prieſthood</hi>] The Prieſthood of Chriſt is ſaid
unchangeable, becauſe it is not tranſitory to change the perſon, and
paſſe from one to another; for ſeeing he lives for ever, and hath no
ſucceſſor, therefore the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood doth alwayes remaine in his
perſon. For, becauſe his perſon is unchangeable and continueth for ever,
therefore alſo his Prieſthood is unchangeable and continueth for ever in
his perſon.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the
uttermoſt.</hi>] From the former verſe, he drawes this as a conſectary;
wherein appeares a great difference betweene Chriſt and the legall prieſts,
and his great prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence above them. Namely, that Chriſt is able to ſave
for ever, and at all times; which none of them could doe. To the uttermoſt,
in the originall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the
uttermoſt of time, at all times, and for ever; for uttermoſt muſt be
referred to the perfection or fulneſſe of time, and not of his ſaving.
For although the ſalvation it ſelfe, which Chriſt our Prieſt brings
unto us, be in all points perfect and complete; yet this in this place is not
deduced from the former verſe, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61860:72"/>onely: So
that to the uttermoſt, is all one with continually and perpetually, as
appeares by the latter words of this verſe, wherein the Author ſhews the
reaſon of this, as we ſhall ſhew there. <hi>Able to ſave</hi>] This
ſalvation in reference to Chriſt, is in it ſelf (as we ſaid) moſt
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and abſolute: For Chriſt ſaveth us, as he takes away all the
guilt and puniſhment of all our ſinnes; as he ſuccours us in our
infirmities, from ſinking under them, and conſequently from falling into
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for our ſinnes thereupon; as he receives our ſoules into his
hands, which he reſtores us in due time, inveſted with eternall glory and
happineſſe: Whereof wee treated; chap. 2. and 4. and 5. <hi>That come unto
God by him.</hi>] Chriſt doth not ſave all men actually, but them that come
unto God by him. To come unto God, is to worſhip God and ſerve him with all
our heart, by offering ſacrifices unto him; as the Author ſpeakes
afterward, chap. 13.15. <hi>Let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to
God.</hi>] And to come to God by Chriſt, is to worſhip God in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Chriſt, truſting upon him; and in obedience of Chriſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his
Commandements; and to worſhip him in worſhipping of Chriſt, by adoring,
praiſing and praying to Chriſt. For he that doth this, doth not ſo much
worſhip and ſerve Chriſt, as God himſelfe by Chriſt. <hi>Seeing hee
ever liveth to make interceſsion for them.</hi>] In theſe words hee
expreſly addes the reaſon of the Conſectary, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the
verſe. Chriſt is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, continually, and
perpetually, becauſe hee liveth to the uttermoſt, continually, and
perpetually; for he <hi>liveth ever.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to make
interceſſion, by way of reſemblance, to the legall Prieſt, who by
entring and offering in the moſt holy place, did make interceſſion: So
alſo Chriſt, by his entrance into the heavenly tabernacle, by his owne
blood, and by his perpetuall reſidence there, in procuring our ſalvation,
and the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſinnes, is ſaid to make interceſſion for us.
But as hee hath all power given him by his Father, as he himſelfe ſaves us,
and expiates our ſinnes, as he beſtowes all happineſſe upon us; ſo he
cannot be ſaid to make interceſſion for us: although theſe actions
differ rationally ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then really: ſeeing in them hee conveyes that to
us, which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of his Father for us, and therefore cannot properly be
ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede or ſue for that, which hee hath full power to give of
himſelfe; for God hath freely given him that full power.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>For ſuch an high Prieſt became us.</hi>] Hee
brings a reaſon, why Chriſt was made a Prieſt to live for ever, to make
interceſſion for us; becauſe ſuch a Prieſt did become us, or was
convenient for us. Whence it appears that the following attributes given unto
Chriſt, do not notifie the innocent life of Chriſt, which was indeed
ſpotleſſe and blameleſſe; but his happy and bleſſed ſtate,
whereby it comes to paſſe that he ever lives, and ever hath a care of us.
For although thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are moſt true of Chriſt, if wee
underſtand them of his life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie: <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61860:73"/>yet being
ſo underſtood in this place, they make nothing to the preſent purpoſe
of the Authour. <hi>Who is holy,</hi>] In reſpect of his immortall nature,
which doth make him a Saint, by ſanctifying and hallowing him.
<hi>Harmeleſſe,</hi>] Not actively to do no harme, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to
have no harme, by freeing him from all evill and miſerie.
<hi>Vndefiled,</hi>] His ſtate is purely happy and bleſſed, not ſtained
or blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any adverſity or evil. <hi>Seperate from ſinners,</hi>]
both in place and condition, not converſing any more with them, as once he
did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. <hi>And made higher then the heavens.</hi>] He is now exalted
above the two lower regions of heaven, and ſeated in the higheſt region, at
the right hand of God. All theſe are ſaid of Chriſt in ſome manner by
way of reſemblance to the legall Prieſt. Although in theſe againe there
be a great diſparity betweene Chriſt and him, as we ſhall ſhew
preſently. Yet if we reſpect the dignity of Prieſthood, the legall
Prieſt was a venerable and holy perſon; hee was harmeleſſe and
inviolable; and as his providence and care could lead him, he was undefiled,
and hee was ſeparate from ſinners, not converſing with them, but
reſiding in the Sanctuary, which reſembled heaven. But all theſe could
not be perfect in the legall Prieſt, by reaſon of his infirmities; or if
they had been moſt perfect, yet they had been but a ſhadow of thoſe
moſt divine qualities, which were ſhewed before in Chriſt. Now that
ſuch a Prieſt became us, the thing it ſelf declares: for unleſſe he
were ſuch a one, hee could not be perpetually vigilant &amp; intent over our
ſalvation, to ſave all that ſhould come to God by him. For the contraries
to theſe qualities, would either trouble the functions of his office, or
wholly hinder them: for even the legall Prieſt, if at any time he were
defiled, might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the holy ſervices to offer for others, or
ſacrifice for their ſin, till firſt he had made ſome entrance in
ſacrificing for his owne.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>Who needed not daily as thoſe high Prieſts,
to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his owne ſinnes and then for the
peoples</hi>] He ſhews another difference between Chriſt and the legall
Prieſts, depending on the former diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and conſequent from them. For
the legall Prieſts muſt offer ſacrifices yearly, firſt for their owne
ſinnes, and then for the peoples: but Chriſt did this only once. Daily;
<hi>i.</hi> upon the determine and ſet day for the yearly ſacrifice, which
was the day of expiation. For that the Author means that yearly ſacrifice, it
appears from his ſaying, that thoſe Prieſts muſt offer firſt for
their owne ſinnes and then for the peoples. But we read not that either hee
did or was to doe this at any other time, then at that yearly ſacrifice of
expiation. For at other times he muſt either offer for himſelfe alone, if
he ſtood guilty of ſome ſin; or if he were partaker of ſinne with the
people, he muſt expiate it with one only ſacrifice for himſelfe and them
together; and not ſacrifice firſt for himſelfe, and after for them. See
afterward chap. 10. v. 11. where <hi>daily</hi> is likewiſe taken for the
appointed and ſet day. <hi>For this hee did <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61860:73"/>once</hi>]
He ſpeaks of Chriſt our Prieſt. What did Chriſt once? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
nothing elſe, but what the old high Prieſt did yearly upon the ſet day.
But it is manifeſt from the former paſſages, and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the
reaſons, that he ſpeaks not here principally of the offering for the
peoples ſinnes on that day; but eſpecially for the offering for the
ſinnes of the Prieſt himſelfe. Sinnes are properly tranſgreſſions
of Gods Lawes, which ſeeing they had no place in Chriſt, for hee knew no
ſinne, therefore there muſt needs be an impropriety in the word ſinnes
here, for by them muſt be meant the infirmities and ſufferings of Chriſt,
whereof we ſpake before chap. 5.2,3. For we have already ſeen that the
contraries to theſe infirmities and ſufferings, were in the next verſe
before deſcribed by the names of holineſſe and harmleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
for theſe two verſes do mutually illuſtrate each other. <hi>When he
offered up himſelfe</hi>] He ſhewes when Chriſt offered for himſelf,
name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayers and ſupplications, as we heard before, chap. 5.7. And then he
offered for himſelfe, when he offered himſelfe for God, when hee prepared
himſelfe for the offering of himſelfe; <hi>i.</hi> when he was ſlaine as
a ſacrifice. For the offering of Chriſt in this place muſt be ſo farre
extended, as to compriſe his death, as a neceſſary antecedent, or a kind
of beginning and entrance to it. Therefore Chriſt, becauſe hee now lives
happy and bleſſed for ever, and nothing can interrupt or hinder his
happineſſe, therefore I ſay, he is now ſecure of himſelfe, and need
no more offer for himſelfe, but is only carefull for us and our ſalvation.
Yet becauſe the time was once, when he was forced to offer for him ſelfe,
therefore being well acquainted with ſufferings, he will ſo much the more
readily ſuccour the diſtreſſed. But ſeeing this verſe depends upon
the former, and is inferred from thence; it appears therefore that the former
verſe ſpeaks not of the manners of Chriſt our Prieſt, but of his
bleſſed ſtate and condition. For Chriſt needs not therefore not offer
any more for himſelfe, becauſe he was holy and harmleſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his manners and actions here upon earth, ſeeing he was alwaies ſo, but
becauſe by his Reſurrection to Immortality, he was freed from all harmes
and evills for ever. As therefore the ſinnes of our Prieſt ſignified his
ſufferings and paines: ſo the contraries to theſe his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and
harmleſſeneſſe in the former verſe declare him exempt and free from
all ſuch evills.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>For the Law made men high Prieſts which have
infirmity</hi>] Hee addes the cauſe of this difference between Chriſt and
the legal Prieſts, becauſe the Law made men high Prieſts which have
infirmity; <hi>i.</hi> ſuch as can never depoſe their infirmity, which
alwayes held them in this condition, that after expiation for their ſinnes
and errors, they againe fell into the like ſinnes and errors, which required
againe another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation. <hi>But the word of the oath which was ſince the
Law</hi>] The word containing the oath, whereof he ſpake before, verſ. 20.
That oath <pb n="142" facs="tcp:61860:74"/>whereby Chriſt was ordained Prieſt was
ſince the Law; and therefore the Prieſthood of Chriſt is no way depending
or eſtabliſhed by the Law. For here the word of the oath made ſince the
Law is oppoſed to the Law. <hi>Maketh the ſonne who is conſecrated for
evermore</hi>] Maketh the ſonne Prieſt. The ſonne is here put eminently
for the Sonne of God, and oppoſed to common men, who have infirmities, as
thoſe men had whom the Law made Prieſts; ſo in many places of Scripture
Chriſt is oppoſed to the reſt of men. See Gal. 1.1. and Epheſ. 2.7.
<hi>Conſecrated for evermore.</hi>] Chriſt is expiated for evermore; not in
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the time paſt, as of old under the Law, under which the
Prieſts by reaſon of their infirmities were forced to renue their expiation
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year. But Chriſt by his one ſingle expiation upon the croſſe,
was freed from all further ſufferings and paines for evermore; ſo that hee
hath no further need to expiate or offer for them any more for ever. And hence
againe it appears, that Chriſt was not fully perfectly our high Prieſt,
before he was conſecrated, expiated, and perfected, for evermore. That is,
before he became immortall.</p>

manner of perſon hee is, and for his dignity, how farre hee exceedeth the
legall Prieſts: Now being partly to adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further, and partly to
repeat ſomething formerly ſpoken, he calles this repetition the ſumme of
what hee had ſpoken. Now the <hi>ſumme</hi> may ſignifie either the
breviat of what hee had ſpoken, or elſe the maine head and principall
point, which laſt ſenſe is moſt agreeable to this place: <hi>q.d.</hi>
Of all thoſe things which have been or may bee ſpoken concerning Chriſt
our high Prieſt, the main head or principall point is this, That we have
ſuch an high Prieſt who is ſet on the right hand, &amp;c. <hi>Who is
ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the heavens</hi>] Of
theſe words we treated chap. 1.3. And by them is ſignified unto us ſo
great a dignity and Majeſty in Chriſt our high Prieſt, that there was
ſcarce extant any ſhadow of it in the ancient legall Prieſts; ſeeing
none of them did ever ſit at the right hand of that throne, which was placed
in the oracle of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, namely of the Mercy-ſeat or covering of the
Arke, which was all over ſhadowed by the wings of the Cherubines, and called
the Throne of God; whereupon God was ſaid to ſit between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines:
But all thoſe legall high Prieſts, when they entred into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (or
moſt holy place of the Sanctuary) were forced to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke,
and ſo before the Mercy-ſeat upon it. But Chriſt is ſo great an high
Prieſt, that he ſits on the right hand of the throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and
that in heaven. <hi>The throne of</hi> the Majeſty, is the Majeſticke and
ſtately Throne, whereon he ſits, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
who only is Almighty, who only hath immortality, and dwells in a light
unapproachable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true
Tabernacle</hi>] The Epethite or Attribute true, muſt be added both to
Sanctuary and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; that Chriſt is a Miniſter of the true Sanctuary,
and of the true Tabernacle; which is Gods heavenly habitation. This is called
the true Sanctuary and Tabernacle, not in reference to falſe and fained
Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but in reſpect of umbratilous and terrene Sanctuaries, which
did but repreſent and ſignifie the true, perfect, ſolid, and heavenly
Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <pb n="145" facs="tcp:61860:75"/>wherein God himſelfe doth really and truely
dwell; and whereto the name of the true and right Sanctuary doth perfectly
agree. Of this true and heavenly Sanctuary Chriſt is the Miniſter, as
anciently the legall high Prieſt was the minſter of the terrene Sanctuary.
For theſe words ſerve ſomewhat to declare the reſidence of Chriſt at
the right hand of Gods throne. Now to bee a Miniſter of the Sanctuary is
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to Miniſter unto God in the Sanctuary, to officiate and
be buſied about the Sanctuary, to procure and order the things that pertaine
to the worſhip of God in the Sanctuary. And Chriſt recide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven
doth Miniſter there, by executing Gods decrees, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering heavenly things,
and whatſoever pertaines to Gods heavenly worſhip and ſervice,
preſcribed and commanded in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The word Leiturgiſt or
Miniſter doth not always ſignifie a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple officer, waiter, or
hand-ſervant: but many times ſuch a one, who with ſpeciall authority and
power doth execute ſome charge; as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall high Prieſts in the
Tabernacle had the chief authority and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency over all things pertaining
to divine worſhip. <hi>Which the Lord pitched and not man</hi>] Either
theſe words containe the cauſe, why that heavenly Sanctuarie is called the
true Tabernacle, becauſe it was erected, not of man, as that was under the
Law, but God himſelfe, who is our Soveraigne Lord. For that Sanctuary muſt
needs bee the true and right one, which the hand of man did not frame for God,
but which God raiſed for himſelf by his owne hand. Or elſe theſe words
are added, to amplifie and illuſtrate the point, to make it the more
evidently appeare, how much this heavenly Sanctuary differs from the earthly,
and exceeds it. So alſo Paul to the earthen and fraile tabernacle of our
mortall body oppoſeth that heavenly building of our glorious body made of
God, and not by the hand of men. Ye have the ſame oppoſition afterward in
this Author between the earthly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and the heavenly, chap. 9. verſe
11.24. in like manner betweene cities made by the hand of men, and that
heavenly city prepared for the godly, whoſe Architect and Builder is God
himſelfe, Chapter 11.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For every high Prieſts is ordained to offer gifts
and ſacrifices:</hi>] He proves that Chriſt our high Prieſt is a
Miniſter of the Sanctuary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ordained to offer gifts and
ſacrifices; for this function is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to the office of a Prieſt; and
he that offers gifts and ſacrifices muſt needs be the Miniſter of a
Sanctuary. <hi>Wherefore it is of neceſsitie this man have ſomwhat alſo
to offer.</hi>] The ſence of theſe words is not ſo to be taken, as to
leave a ſcruple in us; as if Chriſt had only ſomwhat that he might offer;
and yet wee might doubt whether hee would offer, or muſt offer, or doth
indeed offer; but that according to the nature of his office, hee doth actually
offer: For in this ſence wee often ſay, I have ſomthing to give, or to
ſay unto you. <hi>i.</hi> I will, or muſt give, or ſay 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61860:76"/>ſomthing unto you. From theſe words of the Author it
is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Chriſt doth now offer in heaven; for as the
Author will ſhew afterward, he offers himſelfe to God. For hee proves (as
we have ſaid) that Chriſt doth miniſter in the heavenly Sanctuary, as
appeares by the precedent and ſubſequent paſſages. And this hee proves
from hence, becauſe every Prieſt, and therefore Chriſt, is ordained to
offer gifts and ſacrifices; and therefore if he will performe his office, hee
muſt indeed offer; which if hee doe, then it followes that hee is a
miniſter of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For if be were on earth, hee ſhould not be a
Prieſt.</hi>] Here hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the other part of the ſecond verſe,
that Chriſt is a Miniſter, not of the umbratilous and terrene Sanctuary,
but of the true and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe if he were on earth, he ſhould not
be a Prieſt at all. Hence it appears that Chriſt is a Miniſter of the
heavenly Sanctuary, and doth offer unto God there. Whence it neceſſarily
follows, that Chriſt while he was upon earth, did not finiſh his perfect
expiatory offering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Author treats in this Epiſtle. For could hee
performe and finiſh it, being out of his proper Sanctuary which is heaven?
<hi>Seeing that there are Prieſts that offer gifts according to the
Law.</hi>] Hee gives here a reaſon why Chriſt ſhould not be a Prieſt,
if he miniſted on earth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are already other Prieſts
ordained of God, to Miniſter on earth, and to offer gifts; of whoſe number
Chriſt is none, nor can be, as was ſhewed in the former Chapter. Theſe
terrene Prieſts are ſaid to offer according to the Law; becauſe the Law
hath granted them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this right and priviledge, that no other perſon
beſide themſelves without breach of the Law, ſhould uſurpe the office
of offering upon earth, or miniſtring in the earthly Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Who ſerve unto the example and ſhadow of
heavenly things.</hi>] In theſe words, either the Author gives a reaſon,
why Chriſt if hee were on earth, could not be a Prieſt; namely, becauſe
thoſe Prieſts who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer here on earth, ſerve but for a ſhadow of
heavenly things: but Chriſt our high Prieſt, muſt not ſerve for ſuch
a ſhadow. Or els he illuſtrates from the contrary, that Chriſt is a
Miniſter of the true Tabernacle: but the legall Prieſts did only ſerve as
paternes and ſhadows of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctuary. By heavenly things, he means
the Sanctuary and holy functions, wherein Chriſt doth miniſter in heaven.
<hi>As Moſes was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of God when he was about to make the
Tabernacle. For ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou make all things according
to the paterne ſhewed to thee in the mount.</hi> He proves from a teſtimony
of Scripture; that the ancient legall high Prieſts ſerved but as a paterne
and ſhadow of the true and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctuary. And he cites the words
wherein Moſes is commanded to make that ancient Tabernacle, and all things
pertaining to it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the model or paterne ſhewed him in the Mount.
Exod. 25.40. Therefore the Tabernacle ſhewed him in the Mount, was the type
or <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61860:76"/>modell; and the Tabernacle made by Moſes was but a
ſample or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of that model. Now that modell ſhewed by God in the Mount,
according to the paterne and faſhion whereof, Moſes ſhould take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to
frame the Tabernacle, as neere as the art of mans hand could worke it, and as
the materials would beare, was without all queſtion for the faſhion of it
farre more excellent then that which was framed to the likeneſſe of it out
of groſſe and earthly materials. And becauſe it was ſhewed him upon the
Mount, it was therefore in a manner hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, in reſpect of that Tabernacle
which was to be made below the Mount. Although that originall patterne or
modell alſo was but an empty ſhadow of that true Sanctuary whereof Chriſt
is the Miniſter. So that the ancient Tabernacle was but a paterne of a
paterne, and the ſhadow of a ſhadow.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But now hath he obtained a more excellent
Miniſtery</hi>] The particle <hi>now</hi> here notes not a difference of
time, but is an adverbe adverſitive, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the dignity of
Chriſts Miniſtery above the Legall Prieſts. They ſerved as ſhadowes
of heavenly things: but Chriſt our Prieſt hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more excellent
Miniſtery; becauſe he is the Miniſter of a farre more excellent
Sanctuary; which alſo requires a more excellent way of adminiſtring,
convenient and ſutable unto it. <hi>By how much alſo he is the Mediatour of
a better Covenant</hi>] He proves yet further that Chriſt hath obtained a
better Miniſtery; becauſe he is the Mediatour of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and
ſo much better, by how much the Covenant is better. For, look how much the
Covenant, whereof Chriſt is the Mediator, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the former
Covenant; ſo much is his Miniſtery under it, better then theirs, who
miniſtred under the former Covenant. For the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the Prieſthood
muſt correſpond in dignity; ſeeing (as we ſaid in the former Chapter)
the dignity of the Prieſthood doth chiefly depend upon the end &amp; uſe of
it. And the end &amp; uſe of the Prieſthood depends upon the Covenant; for
Gods promiſes are ſetled by the Covenant, and we obtaine them by the
Prieſthood. And here begins another part of the Chapter, wherein is contained
a compariſon of the new Covenant with the old. To be the Mediatour of Gods
Covenant, is nothing elſe, but to be the Interpreter of God, or the
Interceſſor, paſſing betweene God and men with mutuall meſſages, to
make and finiſh up the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on both parties: by which
Inter-meſſenger God declares and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his wil to men, and they
again informed in the knowledge of Gods will, do comply with God and contract
with him, are reconciled with him, &amp; enjoy their peace afterward. For what
is here implyed, that Paul expreſſeth, Gal. 3.19. where he ſhews that
there was a Mediatour alſo of the old Covenant, even Moſes. And we muſt
take notice, that even in this reſpect Chriſt hath ſurpaſſed the
Legall Prieſts; becauſe they were Prieſts onely to the old Covenant, and
not Mediatours of it: but Chriſt is both Prieſt and Mediatour of the new
Covenant, that is farre <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61860:77"/>more excellent then the old.
<hi>Which was eſtabliſhed upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>] In theſe words he
proves that the Covenant whereof Chriſt is the Mediatour, is better then the
former; becauſe it is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes. Every man
ſees, that any Covenant is ſo much the better, by how much the promiſes
are better therein contained. Seeing therefore, that in the new Covenant,
whereof Chriſt is the Mediatour, there are contaiend better promiſes;
therefore it muſt needs be better then the old; and be ſo much better, as
the promiſes are better. Hence it is appearent, that eternall life was not
openly promiſed in the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, nor a full forgiveneſſe of all
ſinnes. For, ſeeing nothing can be found better to men then theſe two
things; if both theſe were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the old Covenant, how can the new
Covenant be ſaid to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon better promiſes? But we urge
this principally concerning the full remiſſion of ſinnes; for this onely
is epreſly mentioned in the deſcription of the new Covenant; and we deny
not but that eternall life was occultly and ſecretly compriſed in the
promiſes of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; as Paul doth manifeſt it, who interprets and
takes the words of the Law, promiſing life to them who exactly keepe all the
precepts of it, to be underſtood of eternall life and juſtification, ſuch
as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by Chriſt. See Rom. 10.5. and Gal. 3.12. The Law therefore did
promiſe life eternall in a ſecret and hidden ſence; but withall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
condition of exact and abſolute obedience in all points, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
granted no expiation in reſpect of eternall death; and the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which
it granted for ſome temporall puniſhments, did not extend to all ſins,
but onely to errours and frailties, or ſuch lapſes whereinto men are prone
to fall. Notwithſtanding, when the whole Nation had been ſeverely
puniſhed of God, and by that puniſhment were brought to a ſence of their
ſins, and to returne to the ſervice of God, then the Law by an
everlaſting Covenant, granted them forgiveneſſe of all their grievous
offences, in reſpect of all temporary puniſhments for this life without any
Sacrifices intervening, See Levit. 26.40. to the end of the Chapter. But the
new Covenant containes a moſt open and cleere promiſe of eternall life; and
therefore is truly ſaid to promiſe eternall life. For a hidden promiſe
and unknowne to the party to whoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it is made, or being ſuch that
no man can be certainly aſſured of it, or at leaſt doth not appeare to be
certaine, muſt not be truly called a promiſe, eſpecially in that fence
wherein a promiſe is here to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when we ſpeake of the promiſes of
the Covenant. Beſides, the new Covenant requires of no man an exact and
abſolute obedience in all points; but is content with true repentance and
with ſuch an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life as carrieth a will never to offend God more;
and therefore truſting to the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, we accuſtome
our ſelves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to no ſin, but walke in the wayes of all vertues;
although it may fall out, that afterward through humane frailty we may
ſometime ſlip; <pb n="149" facs="tcp:61860:77"/>in which point is contained the
forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes. They who thinke the contrary to what we have
aſſerted, do affirme, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the new Covenant are
therefore called better, becauſe they are cleerer. But we thereupon demand,
whether they thinke the old promiſes ſo cleere that men may certainly know
and beleeve them by vertue of the Covenant, or not? If they ſay the firſt
that they are ſo cleere; then we deny it, not onely of the remiſſion of
ſins, which the very nature of Moſes Law requiring the merit of works doth
reject, but alſo of eternall life. Neither could the Author call the
promiſes in the new Covenant ſimply better therefore, becauſe they are
therein propoſed either ſomewhat more cleerely or much more cleerely; much
leſſe could he gather from thence that he dignity of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was
greater then that of the old; and yet againe, much leſſe could he thence
inferre, that the Prieſthood of Chriſt is better then the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: neither
was it any way convenient that therefore the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be
abrogated and a new one made. For a declaration of an old Covenant is not a new
Covenant, diverſe from the old; neither doth ſuch a declaration abrogate
the old, but rather illuſtrate and eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bliſh it. And a new Covenant doth
require, not a declaration of the old, but new conditions, and new promiſes
made of Gods Name. Neither had Chriſt beene the Mediatour of the new
Covenant, but onely an Interpreter and explainer of it. But if they ſay the
latter, that they were not ſo cleer; we willingly grant that, of eternall
life: but not of a full remiſſion of all ſinnes given to ſuch as
amended their wayes; for this was no way contained in the old Covenant, either
openly or covertly, but was altogether repugnant to that Covenant. And (as we
have already ſaid) ſuch a covert promiſe, muſt not be truly accounted
for the promiſe of a Covenant, but onely ſuch a promiſe as every man may
underſtand, and be aſſured of it from the Covenant, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the
conditions. <hi>Was eſtabliſhed</hi>] In the Originall it is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> was enacted or
ordained as a Law; becauſe every Covenant is a Law upon the parties betweene
whom it is made; and the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is moſt juſtly ſo, becauſe it
containes diverſe precepts, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is bound to obſerve, if he
meane to obtaine the promiſes therein made to him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>For if that firſt Covenant had beene
faultleſſe, then could no place have beene ſought for the ſecond</hi>]
Here he proves, what he formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the new Covenant was
eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes; becauſe the old Covenant was faulty;
not that it was abſolutely evill, but onely reſpectively, becauſe it had
ſome imperfections and defects which might be bettered. Whence it plainly
appeares, that ſo good promiſes cannot be therein contained; for if it did
containe them it could not be juſtly blamed, nor truly ſaid to be faulty.
For how can that Covenant be juſtly blamed, which both containes the beſt
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61860:78"/>and alſo preſcribes the beſt conditions
whereby thoſe promiſes may be attained? But that it was indeed blameable,
and was not fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, he proves from hence, becauſe <hi>there was
place ſought for a ſecond</hi>] God promiſed to make a ſecond and a new
Covenant with his people. But why ſhould God abrogate the old Covenant and
make a new, if the old were without all fault, and contained both promiſes
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions equall in goodneſſe to the new? For old Covenants uſe not
to be aboliſhed but for their defects and faults, as above he ſaid of the
Law, that it was diſanulled for the weakeneſſe and unprofitableneſſe
thereof, chap. 7.18.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>For finding fault with them, he ſaith</hi>] Hee
proves by the words of the Prophet, why the old Covenant was faulty, and
therefore place ſought for the ſecond; becauſe God found fault with it.
<hi>With them</hi>] muſt not be referred to the perſons of the Jews in this
place, though otherwiſe God did finde fault enough with them; but to the
promiſes of the old Covenant, for God findes fault with them; for the Author
ſeems to reflect upon the laſt words of the ſixt verſe before, where
hee ſaith that the new Covenant was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes;
now becauſe the promiſes of the old were not ſo good, therefore God finds
fault with them. <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord</hi>] He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the words of the Prophet, Jer. 31.31. wherein God promiſeth to make a new
Covenant with his people, different from the former Covenant; which God
mentions in ſuch a manner, that he apparently reprehends and blames it; as
afterward ſhall be declared. <hi>When I will make a new Covenant with the
houſe of Iſrael and the houſe of Iudah.</hi>] The houſe of Iſrael is
the poſterity of Jacob; and the houſe of Judah the poſterity of Judah one
of Jacobs ſons. He diſtinguiſheth theſe two people, not that the
poſterity of Judah was not alſo the poſterity of Iſrael or Jacob: but
becauſe at that time the poſterity of Jacob was divided into two Kingdomes;
in one whereof were ten Tribes, who therefore were called by the common name of
the Iſraelites; in the other Kingdome were onely two Tribes, Judah and
Benjamin, which two were denominate from Judah onely; becauſe he was the more
il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Tribe, wherein the race of the Kings deſcended: as the other
Tribes were ſometime called Ephraim, becauſe among them, that was the Tribe
Royall.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with
their Fathers</hi>] He proves here, that the ſecond Covenant ſhould be a
new Covenant; becauſe it ſhould not be like the former, or not according to
it, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from it. <hi>In the day when I tooke them by the hand to
lead them out of the land of Egypt</hi>] Day is put for time, an eſpeciall
word for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; in the time that I brought them out of Egypt. This
plainely deſignes the Covenant made by Moſes at Mount Sinai. <hi>Becauſe
they continued not in my Covenant</hi>] Here he opens the cauſe, why God 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61860:78"/>would make a new Covenant with his people, different and
unlike the former. Becauſe that old Covenant was not of force, to containe
the people in their duty. For hence it came to paſſe that the people
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not in it, but tranſgreſſed it. For he layes downe this
conſequent, to make us underſtand the antecedent of it, which is the
faultineſſe and weakneſſe of that Covenant. For if there had been no
fault nor flaw in the Covenant, but only in the people, the Covenant it ſelf
muſt not have been aboliſhed for the fault of the people only. And
therefore it appeares, that not only the people, but alſo the Covenant it
ſelfe was in fault, why it was not obſerved. <hi>And I regarded them not,
ſaith the Lord.</hi>] This is neceſſarily conſequent from the former.
For hee that continues not in Gods Covenant, he is neglected of God;
<hi>i.</hi> deſerted and forſaken, and not only deſerted, but puniſhed,
for God layes thoſe judgements upon him that are ſpecified in the Covenant,
in caſe it bee not obſerved. Hence it is manifeſt, that that former
Covenant was infirme and unprofitable, ſeeing it could not effect, that the
people who were parties to it, might worſhip God duly and conſtantly, and
obey his Lawes; that reciprocally they might be loved of God, and graced with
his bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with
the houſe of Iſrael (ſaith the Lord)</hi> He brings a reaſon why he
ſaid, that this new Covenant is not according to the former, but unlike and
different from it. Becauſe it was to be ſuch a one, as muſt have
ſufficient power to continue the people in their duty. And this he
ſignifies unto us by the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The houſe of Iſrael is taken
here a little more largely then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not now oppoſed to Judah, but
including it, and ſignifying the whole people of God. For it is uſuall in
the holy Scripture, for the ſame words to be taken ſometime more largely
and amply, ſometime more ſtrictly and narrowly; and therein alſo the
ſame things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſometime more amply, and ſometime more
briefly. Whereof we muſt take notice for the better underſtanding and
reconciling of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places. So the word Faith, is ſometime taken ſo
narrowly, that ſalvation and juſtification is aſcribed to it alone; and
ſometime again more largely to compriſe other vertues in it, ſometime
more, ſometime fewer, according as the ſenſe of the word is extended or
reſtrained. <hi>I will put my lawes into their minde, and write them in their
hearts</hi>] Here he begins to deſcribe the new Covenant: <hi>q.d.</hi> In
the old Covenant I wrote ſome of my Lawes in tables of ſtone, and Moſes
wrote other ſome in a booke, and they were put in the Arke to be kept there.
But my new Covenant ſhall not be according to that way; but by it, I will
write my Laws in their hearts, and put them in their mindes to be kept there.
They ſhall not be arbitrary and poſitive Lawes flowing from my ſole will
and pleaſure; whereof their hearts can conceive no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and whereof
their memories may eaſily faile, ſuch as were moſt <pb n="152" facs="tcp:61860:79"/>Lawes in my former Covenant: but they ſhall be only naturall Lawes
grounded only upon naturall honeſty, and upon the dictates of right reaſon,
that their mindes may eaſily conceive them, and their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries retaine them.
And their owne conſciences ſhall acknowledge them to be convenient, juſt,
right and good. And beſides, they ſhall not have a bare underſtanding of
my Lawes to know them, but an hearty affection to doe them. Now becauſe Gods
Covenant is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in theſe words, therefore hence it appeares, that
this writing of Gods Laws in mens minds and hearts dependes and proceeds from
the nature of the Covenant. And therefore theſe words muſt bee taken within
their force and efficacie, and not neceſſarily extended to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect
of the writing, which is alway left in the free power of man. For this is
intimated unto us by the following words of God at the 12. verſe; wherein God
opens unto us the cauſe, manner or meanes of this, which containeth
wonderfull grace and mercy of God offered to his people; for by this means he
ſaith, it would come to paſſe, that they would ſerve him and keep his
Laws with ſo great fervency. But this way Gods Laws are written upon none but
willing hearts. The ſenſe therefore is. I will make ſuch a Covenant that
ſhall have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent force and power to containe my people in their
duties. For to have Gods Laws written in our mindes and hearts, is nothing
elſe, but to be ſo knowing, ſo mindfull, and ſo affected with them,
that we never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from them, but alwayes obſerve them with all our
endeavour. <hi>And I will be to them a God</hi>] This follows from the former;
as the former clauſe oppoſite to this, [<hi>and I regarded them not</hi>]
followed from the peoples not continuing in his Covenant; which in like manner
is oppoſed to the writing of Gods Laws in mens hearts. For God to be a God
unto us, is to be our ſovereigne Protector to defend us from all evill, and
to be our ſovereigne Benefactor to accumulate us with all his bleſſings.
<hi>And they ſhall be to me a people</hi>] Either this is really the ſame
with the former, and an amplification of it, conſiſting of a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
relation, ſuch as we had before in theſe words, <hi>I will be to him a
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall be to me a ſon,</hi> chap. 1.5. Or elſe, it is as
much as if the Author had ſaid; And they ſhall deale by me as my people
ought to doe, both of us ſhall performe our parts reſpectively: I by
protecting and benefiting them, they by worſhipping and ſerving me.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying. Know the Lord</hi>] They
ſhall not need to admoniſh and exhort one another, firſt to know my lawes
and decrees, and after upon knowledge thereof to obſerve them: but all of
them ſhall bee carried with ſuch alacrity of minde to know and obey mee,
that none ſhall need any remembrancer to put him in minde of it. Neighbour
and brother are taken here for the ſame; for in the Law theſe three names
are coincident, <hi>neighbour, brother</hi> and <hi>friend.</hi> See Lev.
19.18. <pb n="153" facs="tcp:61860:79"/>
                  <hi>For all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the
greateſt.</hi>] Here againe God ſpeaks of the efficacie of this Covenant,
and not of the effect it ſelfe; for it ſhall be able to produce an
univerſall knowledge of God, though in ſome ſingle perſons it produce
it not actually. All of al ſorts, from the leaſt age to the greateſt,
yong &amp; old, from the leaſt ſtate to the greateſt, poor and rich; and
from the leaſt degree to the greateſt, low and high.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>For I will be mercifull to their
unrighteouſneſſe, and their ſinnes and their iniquities will I remember
no more</hi>] Here God opens unto us the cauſe of his ardent affection
towards us, and withall unfolds the nature of this Covenant; namely, that
therein he will be mercifull to all the ſinnes of his people, to their
unrighteouſneſſes, their tranſgreſſions and iniquities, and will
never remember them more. This ſo great a benefit muſt needs oblige all
mens mindes, and in a manner conſtraine them, to conſecrate themſelves
wholly unto God, and conſtantly to perſiſt in the daily obſervation of
his Lawes. Which effect, ſeeing every remiſſion of ſinne cannot
produce, therefore we muſt here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch a one, as hath the power
to doe it; namely, a plenary and perfect remiſſion, whereby ſuch as are
truly and ſeriouſly penitent, and afterward live holily, are releaſed
from the guilt or bond of all their former ſinnes, not only in reſpect of
temporall puniſhment and death, but alſo of eternall death, and withall
eternall life is ordained for them. For this remiſſion of ſinnes, adding
the condition of repentance, hath this vertue and power in it, to withdraw men
from ſinne, and for the future to devote themſelves to God. The words
<hi>unrighteouſneſſe, ſins</hi> and <hi>iniquities,</hi> doe in like
manner teach us, that this remiſſion is plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and perfect, extended to
all manner of ſinnes, even the moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. Hence we ſee, that this
plenary remiſſion of ſinnes is a promiſe proper to the new Covenant.
For in theſe words is evidently proved, what he ſaid before concerning the
new Covenant, that it was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon better promiſes then the old.
This is the myſticall ſenſe of thoſe words of the Prophet; the literall
ſenſe was, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the people of the Jewes from the
captivity of Babylon, and would ſo blot out their former wickedneſſe and
foule ſinnes, that hee would acquit them from all further temporall
puniſhments for them; for which ſo great benefit the people muſt needs
bee marveilouſly bound to God, and induced to ſerve him conſtantly for
ever after. But this ſenſe is far too ſlender to anſwer fully and
ſolidly unto words of ſo high a nature. For at that time, to ſpeake
properly, God neither made any new Covenant different from the former, neither
was that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſuch efficacie and power, as to containe the people in
their duty perpetually after. And therefore it is apparent, that the Holy
Ghoſt intended ſome other ſenſe farre more excellent. In the literall
ſenſe then, that remiſſion, muſt bee underſtood to bee really
performed for the taking away of their temporall puniſhment: 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61860:80"/>but in the myſticall ſenſe, it muſt be
underſtood of Gods promiſe to be performed in due time, for the releaſing
eſpecially of eternall death, under condition of repentance, as the nature of
the new Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. And hence it is, why the Iews being afterward
forgetfull of this divine benefit, as of a thing paſt, did againe fall into
divers ſinnes, and forſake Gods law. But the Chriſtian, or the people of
the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, may be excited to do their duty perpetually, and ſerve God
cheerfully, to the end they may at laſt really obtaine the bleſſing
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, a right whereto they now enjoy, and not make themſelves
unworthy of it by their own fault.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>In that he ſaith a new Covenant, he hath made
the firſt old.</hi>] By theſe words he ſhewes that the old Covenant is in
a manner condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected: For when God ſaith hee will make a new
Covenant, he thereby antiquates and abrogates the old. Whence it plainely
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that the old Covenant was in it ſelfe blameable and faultie; and
therefore contained no great and excellent promiſes in it. And from hence it
is moſt manifeſt that the new Covenant is cleerly different from the old:
neither differs it, onely in perſpicuity and cleerneſſe (as many men
beleeye) but in the very promiſes and conditions of it. <hi>Now that which
decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi>] From the former words
he inferres by the way, that the old Covenant, although at that time it
ſeemed to bee of force among the Jewes, and to ſtand while their Temple and
their ſtate were ſtanding; yet by little and little it grew to decay, as a
thing waxing old, and already anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated of God. For that which waxeth old,
though it bee yet for a time extant and appeare; yet after a while it will
wholly decay and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; ſeeing to wax old is nothing elſe, but by
little and little to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and aboliſhed. This the Authour doth
ominate of Moſes Covenant, and the event was anſwerable to his prediction.
For not long after the Temple and State of the Jews was overthrowne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Moſaick religion, and the publike worſhip of God preſcribed in the
old Covenant did fall and vaniſh; ſo that at this day, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
nothing of it, but onely ſome relicks and ſhatters, in the tolerated
Synagogues of that ſcattered Nation.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hen verily the firſt Covenant</hi>] The
particle <hi>then,</hi> for therefore, ſhewes, that theſe words ſo follow
the former, that in a manner they are deduced or inferred from them. Yet they
ſeem not inferred from the words immediatly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, though they have
ſome connexion even with them alſo: but rather from the words neer the
beginning of the former chapter where the Author made a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of
Chriſt with the legall Prieſts, and affirmed, that their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, their
Miniſtery, and offerings to God, were but terrene ſhadows of that heavenly
Sanctuary, wherein Chriſt doth miniſter and offer himſelfe to God; and
therefore, that the Prieſthod of Chriſt was farre more excellent then
theirs. To this point he ſeemes now to returne, and to handle a little more
largely, what before hee had but briefly touched concerning the miniſtery and
ſervice of the legall Prieſts. The word <hi>firſt</hi> in the originall
hath no ſubſtantive with it, wherewith to agree; yet muſt not be referred
to the Tabernacle, as ſome copies tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it: for it hath a cleare
reference to the Covenant, which in the laſt verſe of the former chapter,
is called the <hi>firſt,</hi> and here againe repeated ſo: for by this
reference of it, all things wil moſt rationally correſpond, and comply both
with the preceding and ſubſequent paſſages. <hi>Had alſo ordinances
of divine ſervice</hi>] Ordinances are inſtitutes. <hi>i.</hi> Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61860:81"/>and poſitive Lawes or precepts depending on the ſole
will and pleaſure of the Law-maker or ordainer; to determine any action for
the manner and other circumſtances, which in it ſelfe, and by the Law of
nature is indifferent and may be done many wayes, to be notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
performed after ſome one way. For Gods Covenant doth not containe promiſes
only, which are to be performed on Gods part ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but they alſo
comprehend Commandements and Precepts of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and duties to be performed
on our part, which we if we enter the Covenant muſt promiſe and covenant to
performe, as God on his part doth covenant to performe his promiſe. The
matter or ſubject of theſe ordinances was <hi>divine ſervice,</hi> how
God ſhould be publikly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſerved. 
<note place="margin">The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of divine worſhip and
ſervice.</note> The originall word here is,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which properly ſignifies
worſhip, and not ſervice; for worſhip and ſervice in reference to God,
though by moſt Interpreters on the holy Scriptures they bee confounded and
put indifferently each for other: yet indeed their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are very different
and contradiſtinct. For <hi>worſhip</hi> properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any holy
reverence, which by ſome lowly geſture we performe to God, as by ſtanding
up, bowing downe, kneeling downe, or falling downe before him; whereof the
Scriptures afford us many examples. But <hi>ſervice</hi> properly ſignifies
any holy action performed immediatly to the honour of God; as prayer, praiſe,
thankſgiving, and ſacrificing; whereof alſo the examples are frequent in
Scripture; and particularly, all the Miniſtery of the legall Prieſthood by
offering gifts and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and incenſe, are commonly termed the
ſervices of the Sanctuary. See Exod. 35.19,21,24. and Numb. 4.4,19,24,27. and
Numb. 8.11,15,22,24,25. and Numb. 18.4,6,7,21,23,31. Thus the publike ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, hath two maine branches; namely, <hi>worſhip,</hi> by holy
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences; and <hi>ſervice,</hi> by holy actions: and each of theſe
againe have their particular kindes under them. And in many paſſages of
Scripture theſe two generals of worſhip and ſervice are joyned together,
thereby as well to include all the wayes of honouring God, as to exclude all
the wayes of honouring Idols and Images. See Exod. 20.5. and Deut. 4.19. and
Deut. 8.19. and Deut. 11.16. and Deut. 30.17. and 1 Sam. 1.3. and 2 King.
17.36. and Jer. 13.10. and Mat. 4.10. And we are to note that the worſhip of
God is in a manner determined by the Law of nature; for it is generally the
ſame in all Ages, and among all Nations, who before, under, and ſince the
Law have worſhipped God with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of holy reverences almoſt alike;
ſo that God hath preſcribed no particular ordinances to regulate how we
ſhould honour him in reſpect of worſhip, becauſe the light of nature
doth ſufficiently inſtruct us that this is to be done with moſt humble,
lowly and reverent geſtures. But for the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, God hath
made eſpeciall proviſion, by divers particular Ordinances under the firſt
Covenant; for therein are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Laws and Precepts for all the ſeverall
ſervices of the Sanctuary, <pb n="157" facs="tcp:61860:81"/>how the offerings of
incenſe, gifts and ſacrifices ſhould be performed. For men muſt not
ſerve God after their owne will and pleaſure, but after his: ſeeing
ſervice muſt not be done after the ſervants pleaſure, but after the
Lords pleaſure to whom the ſervice is done. But now that firſt Covenant
being abrogated, the divine ſervices thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, are alſo
abrogated. And we'are further to note, that when theſe two words of worſhip
and ſervice are not conjoyned in one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but either of them is put
ſingly alone; then many times it is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliated and extended, ſo generally
as to ſignifie the whole honouring of God, and to include the other; for we
finde worſhip put for it ſelfe and ſervice; and ſervice for it ſelfe
and worſhip. And many times they are interchanged, and by a Metonymie of the
adjunct, either is put for the other; as here, though the originall be
<hi>latria,</hi> which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip; yet it is here put for
ſervice, and therefore rightly ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated; for the Ordinances of the
firſt Covenant preſcribed nothing for divine worſhip, but only for divine
ſervice. Hence manifeſtly appears the true and proper difference between
<hi>latria</hi> and <hi>doulia,</hi> whereof the firſt properly ſignifieth
worſhip, and the other ſervice; yet both are honour; and when theſe
honours are divine (for they may be uſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely and civilly; ſeeing
honourable reverences and honourable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices may be due to a Land-lord by
tenure of a Fee) then they are ſo proper unto God, that divinely they cannot
bee communicated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Saints or Angels. And they are ſo concurrent or
connexed each with other, that the right of the one cannot be ſeparated from
the other; but to what perſon ſoever the one is due, to him the other is
due alſo: ſo that if we grant unto the Saints or Angels <hi>cultum douliae;
i.</hi> divine ſervice, wee muſt alſo neceſſarily grant them
<hi>cultum latriae; i.</hi> divine worſhip. Neither can divine ſervice be
performed without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip; for then the ſervice is without
reverence, ſeeing worſhip is nothing elſe but that reverence which is
uſed at or during our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>And a worldly Sanctuary.</hi>] A
Sanctuary is a divine or holy place where divine and holy honours are to bee
done; where divine worſhip and divine ſervice are by divine ordinance to
bee performed. And the legall Sanctuary under the firſt Covenant is called a
worldly Sanctuary, becauſe it was ſeated in this preſent world, and
ſtood in oppoſition to the Sanctuary of the world to come, whereof it was a
figure and a ſhadow. So that by worldly Sanctuary is properly meant a
temporary and earthly Sanctuary; whereas the other is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and
heavenly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For there was a Tabernacle made</hi>] Having
ſpecified two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall things contained in the firſt Covenant; namely,
Ordinances for divine ſervice, and a worldly Tabernacle; he ſeverally
explicates theſe, ſhewing the defects of both: but he begins firſt, with
that which hee named laſt, to wit the Tabernacle: for Orders were firſt for
the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <pb n="158" facs="tcp:61860:82"/>of the Tabernacle, before any Ordinances
were preſcribed for the ſervices of it. For the materialls, frame and
coverings of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, ſee Exod. 26. <hi>The firſt wherein was the
candleſticke, and the table, and the ſhew-bread</hi>] The Tabernacle was
but one ſingle edifice for the fabrick or frame of it: yet there were in it
two partitions, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a rich hanging called the ſecond vaile, in
oppoſition to the firſt vaile at the doore of the Tabernacle. In the
firſt of theſe partitions, which for diſtinction from the inward
partition is here called the firſt Tabernacle (and firſt for entrance
onely, not for dignity) was the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> whoſe matter, frame,
parts and uſe are deſcribed, Exod. 25.31. &amp;c. <hi>and the table,</hi>
whoſe matter, frame, meaſures and parts are deſcribed, Exod. 25.23.
&amp;c. <hi>and the ſhew bread,</hi> which were twelve flat loaves or cakes,
ſet upon the table in two rowes with frankincenſe, and changed every
Sabbath, whereof ſee the making, Levit. 24.5. <hi>Which is called the
Sanctuary.</hi>] This firſt partition of the Sanctuary, was for
diſtinctions ſake from the other, called the Sanctuary or holy place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And after the ſecond vaile, the Tabernacle which
is called the holieſt of all.</hi>] That partition or roome of the
Tabernacle, which was inmoſt, and ſeparated from the outward partition or
room, by the ſecond vail, was called the Oracle or the moſt holy place. The
Hebrews called it the holy of holies; for becauſe their language hath no
ſuperlatives, therefore they uſed to expreſſe a ſuperlative
ſenſe, by a repetition of poſitives.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Which had the golden cenſer</hi>] The golden
Altar, becauſe the uſe of it was for incenſe to bee burnt upon it, is
called here the golden cenſer. So that for the frame or faſhion of it, it
was an Altar, and for the uſe of it, a cenſer. For the matter, form and
meaſures of it, ſee Exod 30.1. This altar or cenſer was indeed in the
fuſt Tabernacle; but becauſe it was placed cloſe up to the vaile, which
parted the ſecond Tabernacle from the firſt, and the inſenſe burnt
thereon, was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to perfume the ſecond or inmoſt roome, therefore
the Author attributes it to the ſecond or inmoſt roome of the Tabernacle.
For we read nothing either in the bookes of Moſes, or elſe where, that
beſides that altar of incenſe, there was any other cenſer in the oracle
or moſt holy place. Neither can it ſtand with reaſon, there ſhould bee
any; for it was not lawfull for the Prieſt to enter into the oracle or moſt
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place without burning incenſe before he entred; and therefore the altar
or cenſer whereon he was firſt to burne incenſe, muſt needs bee without
the oracle, or elſe he could not firſt come at it. <hi>And the arke of the
Covenant overlaid round about with gold</hi>] The Arke was a ſtrong cheſt
or coffer, the matter, forme and meaſures whereof, ſee Exod. 25.10. This
was called the Arke of the Covenant for the uſe of it, which was to incloſe
the tables wherein the firſt Covenant was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61860:82"/>
                  <hi>Wherein was the golden pot that had Manna</hi>] <hi>Wherein</hi>]
muſt be referred to the Arke, as appears by the beginning of the next
verſe; for in this verſe the Author would ſhew what was in the Arke, and
in the next what was over it. This pot of Manna was gathered before the
buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Tabernacle, and commanded to be laid up before the
Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, there to be kept when the Tabernacle ſhould be built. See Ex.
16.33.34. <hi>And Aarons rod that budded</hi>] Concerning Aarons rod, how it
budded, and upon what occaſion, and for what purpoſe it did ſo, See Num.
17. <hi>And the tables of the Covenant</hi>] There were ſeverall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of
the old Covenant, for there were the tables of the Covenant, which the Lord
wrote with his owne finger in ſtone, containing the Decalog: and there was
the booke of the Covenant which Moſes wrote and read in the audience of the
people, and ſprinkled it with bloud, when the Covenant was confirmed with a
ſolemne ſacrifice. See Exod. 24.4. and afterward in this Chapter, verſ.
19. Now wee finde none but the tables of the Covenant to bee laid up in the
Arke; yet not thoſe tables that were firſt written, for they were broken,
upon the indignation which Moſes had at the worſhipping of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Calfe; but the tables written afterward were there reſerved. But how could
the pot of Manna and Aarons rod bee in the Arke, when wee read expreſly, that
nothing was in the Arke ſave the two tables of ſtone, 1 King. 8.9. and 2
Chron. 5.10? The Anſwer is, Either wee muſt ſay that in ſucceſſe of
time, the pot of Manna and Aarons rod, came to bee put into the Arke, which
before were not ſo; Or wee muſt ſay, that the particle <hi>In</hi> here
muſt be a little extended in ſenſe, to include thoſe things that were
adjacent to the Arke, being neare or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. So John is ſaid to baptiſe
in Bethabara, becauſe he baptiſed neare or about it, John 1.28. So Joſhua
is ſaid to be in Jericho, when he was by or neare it. Joſh. 5.13. And in
this ſenſe the Author firſt expreſſeth thoſe things which were by
or neare the Arke, as the pot of Manna and Aarons tod; then the things in the
Arke, as the tables of the Covenant: And laſtly, in the following verſe,
the things over the Arke, as the Cherubims. And this might happily bee the
cauſe, why under the particle <hi>in</hi> hee would firſt compriſe the
things by the. Arke, before thoſe in it, that he might make uſe of this
gradation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And over it, the Cherubims of glory, ſhadowing
the Mercy-ſeate</hi>] The Cherubims were two Images of ſolid gold
faſhioned like wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, whoſe wings did over ſhadow the
Mercy-ſeate: being one at the one end of it, and the other at the other;
having their faces looking one towards another. Of them ſee, Exod. 25.17. And
they were called the Cherubims of glory, by an Hebraiſme; for glorious
Cherubims, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their luſtre and brightneſſe, which in Scripture
is often called glory. The Mercy-ſeate had two uſes; one to bee a Cover for
the Arke, to ſhut up the Tables of the Covenant: the other to repreſent 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61860:83"/>the ſeat or throne of God, where God would ſpeake with
Moſes to give anſwers for the people, and to ſhew himſelfe mercifull.
And the originall word in the Hebrew carries a twofold ſence, to anſwer and
fit this two-fold uſe; for <hi>Capporeth</hi> derived from the verbe
<hi>Caphor,</hi> which ſignifies to cover a veſſell, and to cover
ſinne, which laſt is the proper act of mercy. Therefore though the Hebrew
word might have beene ſimply and fully enough rendred <hi>the Cover,</hi> yet
the Septuagint following the other ſignification of the word, have
tranſlated, Hilaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, <hi>i.</hi> a Propitiatory or Mercy-ſeate,
which diſtinguiſheth this cover from all others, as a peculiar uſe and
property of it. And it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon, that by the ambiguity
of the word, the Spirit of God would ſignifie ſo much. <hi>Of which we
cannot now ſpeake particularly</hi>] Though each of theſe particulars
concerning the firſt Covenant, might require particular explication, and
ſerve highly for advancing the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſts Prieſthood, and of the
new Covenant; yet the time will not now permit it, becauſe our purpoſe
calls us on to other matters.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Now when theſe things were thus ordained</hi>]
Having briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Tabernacle and the ſeverall furniture of it;
now he comes to deſcribe the way of divine ſervice therein; which according
to the two partitions or roomes of the Tabernacle was twofold, whereof he
toucheth the firſt in this verſe, and handleth the other in thoſe
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>The Prieſts went alwayes into the firſt Tabernacle,
accompliſhing the ſervice of God</hi>] The ordinary Prieſts went onely
into the firſt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, for none but the high Prieſt went into the
ſecond. And into the firſt they went alwayes, that is, every day daily; for
herein they are oppoſed to the high Prieſt, who went into the ſecond
Tabernacle once every yeare. The daily ſervices of God accompliſhed by the
Prieſts in the firſt Tabernacle, were to burne Incenſe on the golden
Cenſer, and to light up or mend the Lamps of the Candleſtick, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>But into the ſecond went the high Prieſt alone;
once every yeare</hi>] The high Prieſt went in alone, and therefore he onely;
yet he went not in daily, but yearely once every yeare, at the ſolemne faſt
of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation; whereof ſee Levit. 16. <hi>Not without bloud which he
offered</hi>] Not without bloud, is with bloud; and with bloud onely; for the
high Prieſt offered in the ſecond Tabernacle nothing elſe but bloud. For
he muſt enter thither with the bloud of a Bullock and of a Goate, and offer
it, by ſprinkling it with his finger upon and before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeate
ſeven times. Whence it appeares that this offering of the high Prieſt did
not conſiſt in the ſlaughter of thoſe beaſts whoſe bloud he
offered; and therefore neither did the offering of Chriſt anſwerable
thereto, whereof the Author treates, conſiſt in the death of Chriſt, but
by his entrance into heaven after his death. Indeed the death of Chriſt is
called an offering and ſacrifice; yet it is ſo called for the reſemblance
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61860:83"/>of it with the free-will and peace-offerings, and
therefore eſpecially, becauſe it was moſt gratefull and acceptable to
God: in which reſpect alſo other notable works of piety may be and are
called in Scripture offerings and ſactifices unto God. <hi>For himſelfe,
and for the errours of the people.</hi> Here is a little trajection of the
words; for the right ſence is thus; for the errours of himſelfe, and of the
people; For in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Prieſt offered no otherwiſe for
himſelf then for the people; for ſo we reade it before in this Epiſtle,
chap. 5.3. Now the cauſe of this his offering for himſelfe and the people,
in that anniverſary and yearely Sacrifice, was onely for the errours of both.
And by Errours we muſt here as wee did before, underſtand ſuch ſinnes,
as proceed either from the ignorance or forgetfulneſſe of ſome divine
Law, (for in ſuch a multitude of Laws, and ſo various, reſpecting not
onely matter of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall honeſty and true morality, but of poſitive
Ceremony, ſomething might eaſily eſcape from mens knowledge or memory) or
from the ignorance of ſome fact and the circumſtances of it; or from humane
frailty or infirmity, which might make the fact as excuſable, as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
doth, eſpecially that ignorance which is of the Law. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe
univerſall words in Levit. 16. ver. 16. where in this yearely ſacrifice of
Expiation, the Prieſt is commanded to expiate all the ſins of the people,
and to purge the Sanctuary from them, muſt be reſtrained onely to theſe
ſins of Errors.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, That the way
into the holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt
Tabernacle was yet ſtanding.</hi>] In theſe and the following verſes, the
Author declares, both the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the old Covenant, and the
infelicitie of thoſe times, wherein the Tabernacle and that carnall ſervice
of God laſted. For firſt he ſhewes, that during thoſe times, the way
into heaven was not yet manifeſted and opened; and then he ſhewes the
infirmitie of thoſe ſacrifices for the expiating of ſinne; the latter of
theſe hee doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the firſt is delivered in this verſe. For
here hee teacheth, what was the meaning of this. That no man might enter into
the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tabernacle or moſt Holy place, except the high Prieſt, nor he
neither, but onely once a yeer. To this he ſaith, That the holy Ghoſt; by
whoſe inſtinct all this was ordered, would thereby declare unto us, that
the way was not yet open into the holieſt of all, namely, into the true and
heavenly Sanctuary, as long as that earthly Tabernacle was yet ſtanding, and
continued in that ſtate of holineſſe, which God for a time had
aſſigned unto it. But the abrogation of that Tabernacle, or as I may terme
it, the profanation of it, when the vaile of it was ſo rent and opened, that
any man might lawfully enter it, this did declare that the entrance of the
heavenly Sanctuary was now open to all. The open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the way, and the
libertie of entring that Tabernacle, being granted unto all (which was then
done, when God would have that <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61860:84"/>Tabernacle to be holy no
longer) doth deſigne unto us a libertie and fredome granted unto all, of
entrance into the heavenly Sanctuarie, which is truely and indeed the moſt
Holy place of all. For hence it was, that as ſoone as Chriſt had given up
the Ghoſt and was dead, whereby our paſſage into heaven was made open,
the vail of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was rent from the top to the bottome, that it might no
longer keep any man from entring into the holy place. That none are yet
actually entred into the Sanctuary of heaven, beſide Chriſt our high
Prieſt, the cauſe is not, that the faithfull have not a right and a
libertie to enter, but becauſe they muſt firſt put off the ragges of
their mortall nature, which being done, then in their due time, namely, at the
comming of Chriſt, they ſhall enter by multitudes into that heavenly
Sanctuary, the palace of Immortalitie, and then take poſſeſſion of that
inheritance, whereto now they have but a title.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Which was but a figure for the time then
preſent</hi>] Hee teacheth here the maine uſe of the Tabernacle, and of the
divine ſervice annexed unto it; that all was but for a figure or a ſhew, a
myſterie, or a maske of ſomthing to be further underſtood by it; which as
before wee have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, was the true heavenly Sanctuary, and the true
worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God to be performed there by Saints and Angels. And
it was but a temporary figure to laſt only for a time, during the time
preſent, as it is oppoſed to the time to come, or as the Author determines
it in the next verſe, until the time of Reformation. <hi>Wherein were offered
both gifts and ſacrifices</hi>] He intimates here that the divine ſervice
by gifts and ſacrifices was alſo figurative as well as the Tabernacle; and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he declares the time which was aſſigned for this figurative
Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, how long it ſhould continue and when it ſhould determine:
Namely, that the figurative Tabernacle muſt laſt as long as the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſervice, for whoſe ſake it was ordained, as long as gifts and
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were to be offered. Whereby he yet further intimates, that with
great reaſon it ſtood, that the Tabernacle (or Temple in the roome of it)
ſtood not now in force; for ſeeing the figurative ſervices of offering
gifts and ſacrifices were but temporary, ordained only till the time of
Reformation; therefore thoſe figurative ſervices being aboliſhed, the
figurative Tabernacle alſo which was but ſubſervient to thoſe
ſervices muſt needs be aboliſhed. <hi>Which could not make him that did
the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience</hi>] By him that did
the ſervice, is not meant the Prieſt onely who made the offering, but
alſo any other perſon, who brought his offering for a gift or ſacrifice,
thereby to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve God; who thereupon might juſtly be called
the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſervitor of God. The ſervices therefore by offerings
of gifts and ſacrifices, could not make the ſervitors perfect. To make
perfect, here, is fully to expiate ſinne, as wee heard before, chap. 7. ver.
11.19. And to perfect as pertaining to the conſcience, is nothing elſe, (as
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61860:84"/>by the oppoſition of thoſe ſins, which in
the verſe following are ſaid to be expiated by the Legall ſacrifices) but
to purge away, or expiate thoſe ſins, which polluted and burdened the
conſcience it ſelf, and not thoſe onely which defiled the fleſh and
made the party out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly uncleane; nothing elſe but to aboliſh all guilt
even of the moſt heinous ſins; and ſo to aboliſh it, that thou ſhalt
not feare not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments onely, but not eternall alſo: and
beſides that thou maieſt hope for eternall life, and be aſſured, that
thy ſins paſt, though they have beene very grievous, ſhall not exclude
thee from ſalvation; upon condition, thou change the courſe of thy life,
and carry thy ſelfe holily for the time to come; and as much, as ſuch a
tried hope of ſalvation can draw thee, and ſo great a favour of God can
excite thee, and thy truſt in his helpe can ſupport thee, to endeavour by
all meanes to keepe thy ſelfe unblameable and free from all ſin.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Which ſtood onely in meates and drinks</hi>] He
ſhews what ſins the Legall ſacrifices did expiate, and for what
purpoſes they were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; namely, for the ſins of Legall impurity or
carnall uncleanneſſe; as if a man had eaten or taſted any of thoſe
meates which by the Law were declared uncleane, and forbidden to be eaten; for
which ſee Levit. 11. or if a man had drunke in an uncleane veſſell, or
had taſted of any water, wine or liquor whereinto ſome uncleane thing had
fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; for ſee Levit. 16.32,33. <hi>And divers waſhings and carnall
ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>] Or if a man had neglected to waſh himſelfe or his
clothes, after he was caſually uncleane, either by touching ſome uncleane
thing, or by an iſſue, or by the Leproſie: <hi>And carnall
ordinances</hi>] and ſuch other Ceremonies, ordained of God after an
arbitrary and poſitive way pertaining not to the conſcience, but to the
body and the fleſh, as the touching of a dead carkaſſe, or of any other
uncleane thing. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome morall ſinnes committed againſt the
morall Laws as wee call them, were expiated by Sacrifices; yet none ſuch as
were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preſumptuouſly or with a high hand, and in contempt of Gods
Law, and thereupon truly polluted the conſcience: but onely ſuch (as we
have already noted) wherein ſome excuſable ignorance or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had
place, being lapſes and falls very familiar to man, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Gods
pardon. Beſides, theſe ſins were expiated by thoſe Sacrifices onely
thus farre, that after a full reſtitution in caſe of injury, no other
puniſhment of thoſe ſins was thereby taken away, but that which pertained
to the fleſh or body in this life; for to take away eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment
thoſe Sacrifices were not able. <hi>Impoſed on them</hi>] It is true, that
meates and drinks and diverſe waſhings were impoſed upon Gods Legall
people for a time onely: yet the word <hi>impoſed</hi> hath not reference to
them here, for the Greek text will not beare that conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but it
referres to gifts and ſacrifices in the former verſe; for they were
impoſed to expiate the ſins touching meates and drinkes and 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61860:85"/>diverſe waſhings. Hence we ſee plainly, for what
ſinnes principally under the Law, thoſe Legall ſacrifices were ordained,
and what ſinnes were thereby expiated. We ſee alſo what force thoſe
ſacrifices had in expiating thoſe ſins, that they could not reach unto
the conſciences to waſh away the true and foule ſpots that had ſtained
it; neither could they free them whom they expiated from all feare of divine
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they chiefly waſhed away the ſtaines of the fleſh,
whereby men were accounted uncleane, and thereupon forbidden civill
conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and publique commerce; ſo that theſe impediments from
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and commerce were expiated by thoſe Sacrifices, than men
might paſſe about their worldly affaires. <hi>Vntill the time of
reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>] The gifts and ſacrifices impoſed on the people to
expiate their corporall or carnall ſtaines, were not perpetuall ordinances,
but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary onely for a time; and the terme of that time expired at the time
of Reformation. Which is a generall correction or amendment of all things
whatfoever pertaining either to the ſervice of God, or to the happineſſe
of Gods people, whereby things ſhould be brought to an excellent ſtate and
condition. The time of this Reformation or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is alſo called the
fulneſſe of time, and that time was fully come at the comming of Chriſt;
who as the woman of Samaria ſaid of him, at his comming would tell us all
things; ſhe meant, all things concerning the true worſhip and ſervice of
God. For at the time of his comming, the carnall ſervice of God was turned
into ſpirituall; and ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ordained that by the benefit
thereof men might be throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated in their conſciences; ſo that
freed before God from the guilt of all their ſinnes whatſoever, and
delivered from the feare not onely of temporall but of eternall puniſhment,
they might exult and rejoyce in the hope of immortall life; and then being
inflamed with ſuch high graces and favours from God, and with a care never to
loſe the fruits of them, might burne in love of God and godlineſſe, and
forcibly be carried to every good work.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>But Chriſt being become an high Prieſt of
good things to come</hi>] Hitherto we have had the propoſition of the
compariſon betweene the old Covenant and the new, in reſpect of the
Tabernacle and divine ſervice; Now followes the reddition of it, wherein the
high Prieſt is oppoſed to the high Prieſt, the Tabernacle to the
Tabernacle, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the ſervice, the Sacrifice to the Sacrifice,
the Offering to the Offering, and the Expiation to the Expiation. And all this
he compti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in two verſes, this and the next; which afterwards in the
reſt of the Chapter, he amplifies and illuſtrates. Chriſt was ordained an
high Prieſt long before, and that by oath, as we have heard before, but he
did not actually execute the office of it while the Tabernacle or Temple was
yet ſtanding and in force: but when the vaile of the Temple was tent, that
the Tabernacle was diſanulled, and the time of <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61860:85"/>Reformation was come, then Chriſt entered upon his office &amp;
became an high Prieſt, to execute it for ever after the order of
Melchiſedec. And Chriſt is a high Prieſt of good things to come, in
oppoſition or difference to the old high Prieſt. By good things to come may
be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, either thoſe that were to come in reſpect of the Law, or
thoſe to come in reſpect of this world. In reſpect of the Law; a perfect
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of ſinnes was to come; and in reſpect of this world eternall
life is to come, which is the ſuper-perfection or complement of perfect
expiation. Now Chriſt is our high Prieſt for theſe good things,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we attaine them by his ſacrifice and offering; for he it is, who
provides and takes order for them, as the Legall Prieſt did to procure unto
the people the good things preſent for this life. <hi>By a greater and more
perfect Tabernacle</hi>] If theſe words depend upon the verbe
<hi>entered</hi> in the next verſe; how can Chriſt be ſaid to enter into
the holy place by a Tabernacle that is greater and more perfect, for then he
muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Tabernacle by a Tabernacle? Therefore, either the particle
<hi>by</hi> in this place is put for <hi>in;</hi> and ſo referred to the
preceding words of this verſe, conſidering the Tabernacle as an adjunct to
Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, wherein he doth miniſter; as if the Author had
ſaid, Chriſt is become a high Prieſt both of better things, and of or in
a better Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, greater and more perfect, then that wherein the legall
Prieſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred; Or elſe we muſt ſay, that the Author, becauſe he
mentioned a double Tabernacle terreſtriall, with two partitions or roomes in
it; therefore alſo he conſiders a double Sanctuary celeſtiall, in a
manner anſwerable to the two holy places of the old Tabernacle, the firſt
and the ſecond. The one of thoſe celeſtiall Sacraries is larger and more
common, wherein the Angels abide: the other is more inward and moſt ſacred,
wherein is the throne of the divine Majeſty. For although happily the one be
not ſo ſeperate from the other, as the two holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were in the
Tabernacle and Temple disjoyned by a vaile and a wall: yet it ſufficeth if
they differ in beauty and glory; as in the Courts of great Kings, wee may
diſtinguiſh the place where the Kings throne or chaire of State is
ſeated, by the foot-pace Canopy and furniture of it, from the reſt of the
roome, though it be not ſevered by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the old Tabernacle the
inmoſt and moſt holy place, was at firſt continuous with the reſt of
the Tabernacle, and not ſevered but by availe; for without ſome ſuch
croſſe materiall, the one could not be ſevered from the other: But in
heaven the difference of bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glory ſerves for a vaile.
Chriſt therefore being to enter into the inmoſt and moſt holy place of
heaven, to ſit at the right hand of Gods throne, muſt needs paſſe
through the large and common manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heaven; as the Legall high Prieſt
entered the ſecond Tabernacle by paſſing through the firſt. There are
three things that ſeeme to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this opinion. 1. Becauſe the Author did
mention and deſcribe a <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61860:86"/>double Tabernacle before;
therefore the reſemblance of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth require, that to a double
Tabernacle on earth, there ſhould be anſwerable a double place in heaven,
one a holy place, and the other the moſt holy. 2. Becauſe theſe words doe
indeed ſeeme to depend upon the verbe <hi>entered</hi> in the next verſe,
as appeares by the particle <hi>neither</hi> at the beginning of that verſe,
for that particle doth uſe to couple thoſe things that are contained under
one verbe, which is here the verbe <hi>entered.</hi> 3. Becauſe the high
Majeſty of the Deity ſeemes to require, that in his heavenly Manſion,
which (no queſtion) is moſt ample and ſpacious, there ſhould be ſome
moſt holy place, ſparkling and glittering with the brightneſſe of
unapproachable light, where the moſt high God and ſupreme Lord of all
things hath his throne and reſidence, anſwerable to the moſt holy place
in the Tabernacle, wherein the throne of God was ſaid to be ſeated. This
firſt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of heaven through which Chriſt paſſed, is ſaid to
be greater and more perfect; <hi>i.</hi> then the terrene Tabernacle under the
Law; and it is greater and perfecter not only in quantity but in dignity.
<hi>Not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building.</hi>] Hee
would give one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance at the leaſt to declare the dignity of Chriſts
Tabernacle to bee greater and more perfect then the legall, becauſe it is not
made with hands, or by art of man, as the legall was. Yet becauſe the Author
would ſhew, that by theſe words hee comprehends ſomething more, then
appeares at the firſt ſight; therefore he declares, what he meanes thereby;
namely, that Chriſts Tabernacle is <hi>not of this building.</hi> It is not
only not made by the hand or art of man, but alſo it is not of the number of
viſible creatures; which though they be not made by the hand and induſtry
of men, yet they are like to handy: workes, becauſe they are viſible and
corruptible as handy-works are. In which ſenſe, the Apoſtle oppoſing
the houſe of our glorious body to this of our corruptible and fraile body,
ſaith of it, that it is no handy-worke made with hands, 2 Cor. 5.1. Or
rather, the Tabernacle of Chriſt is ſaid, not to be of this building or
creating; becauſe it is not framed of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible materials or any other
ſtuffe ſubject to the eye, whereof all han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-works wrought by mans art,
are made. Therefore theſe words, <hi>not of the building,</hi> muſt be
extended more largely, then the other, <hi>not made with hands,</hi> doe
properly ſignifie. For it doth not preſently follow, that if it be not made
with hands, therefore it is not of this building; unleſſe as we have
ſaid, wee take a handy-worke made by hand; to ſignifie metaphorically, that
alſo which is like to a handy-worke made by hand; as are all things of this
building or creating, which have been made from the beginning of the world; or
elſe ſo (which comes all to one) as to comprehend all things, which in
reſpect of their matter are of the ſame kinde with handy-workes, as are all
things made of God from the beginning of the world; for of theſe are 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61860:86"/>all handy-workes framed. Hence it appeares, that there is
another building or creature of God, far more excellent then the building or
frame of this world, whoſe forme and matter is of another kinde, far more
faire, pure, ſublime, and ſtable, then this which we ſee. And to this
building, pertaines that heavenly Tabernacle of Chriſt our high Prieſt,
which is the Temple and reſidence of the moſt high God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Neither by the bloud of goats and calves</hi>]
Here he oppoſeth the ſacrifice of Chriſt to the ſacrifice of the old
legall Prieſt. The old high Prieſt entered the moſt holy place by the
blood of goats and calves. But Chriſt entered, not by ſuch baſe bloud,
but by moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bloud, which could be no other, beſides his owne; for
as his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was moſt pretious, ſo muſt needs his bloud be. The bloud
of man is more pretious then the bloud of a beaſt: but the bloud of Chriſt
is far more pretious then the bloud of all men beſides. Seeing Chriſt
himſelf is far more excellent then all other men, yea then all other
erea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for he is more deare and neare unto God then all, as being his
<hi>unigenit</hi> and only begotten Sonne. <hi>But by his owne bloud</hi>] Wee
are to note, that the Author to ſute the elegancie of his compariſon, did
in the firſt member of it uſe the particle <hi>by;</hi> although the legall
high Prieſt entered the holy place, not only <hi>by</hi> the bloud of goats
and calves, <hi>i.</hi> having firſt ſhed the bloud of thoſe beaſts, or
after the ſhedding of their bloud; but alſo <hi>with</hi> their bloud,
which he carryed into the holy place with him and offered it by ſprinkling
it, upon and before the Mercy-ſeat. But in the ſacrifice of Chriſt the
reſemblance could not be extended ſo far, ſeeing Chriſt ſhed not the
bloud of an other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but his owne bloud; neither in his heavenly
Tabernacle did he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his bloud after his death but himſelfe, when hee was
become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and had caſt off the rags of fleſh and bloud, becauſe
they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſeſſe the Kingdome of God. And therefore he entred the
holy place of heaven not with his bloud, but only after hee had ſhed his
bloud. Now becauſe Chriſt entred thus, therefore the Author ſaid
leſſe of the legall high Prieſt then indeed the thing it ſelfe was, and
uſed the particle <hi>by</hi> to fit the compariſon. For in the ſacrifice
of Chriſt, the matter was in part ſomewhat otherwiſe, then in the old
expiatory ſacrifice. In that old ſacrifice, as alſo in other
ſin-offerings, the beaſt it ſelfe that was ſlaine was not offered unto
God, nor burnt as a ſweet ſavour unto him (as the Scripture termes it) but
the kidneyes and the fat of it only; neither was the carkaſſe brought into
the holy place, but the bloud of it only. But in the ſacrifice of Chriſt,
not his bloud which he ſhed when he was ſlaine, but he himſelfe muſt be
offered, and hee muſt enter the holy place of heaven by himſelfe. For hence
afterward at the 14. verſe it is ſaid, that Chriſt offered himſelfe to
God, and not his bloud; although otherwiſe the compariſon with the
expiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſeem to require this latter reſemblance. <hi>He
entred in once into <pb n="168" facs="tcp:61860:87"/>the holy place</hi>] The entrance into
the moſt holy place is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to that ſacrifice; for the
Offering (wherein the nature of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice chiefly conſiſteth) could
not be performed before the entrance, becauſe it muſt be made in the holy
place, by ſprinkling upon and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mercy-ſeat. Hence it is
manifeſt that the offering and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt our high Prieſt was
not made upon the Croſſe, but was performed in heaven, and is yet in the
performing. Into this true holy place of heaven Chriſt entred but once, not
often and yearly as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gali high Prieſt did. <hi>Having obtained eternall
redemption</hi>] Now hee oppoſeth the Expiation obtained by the offering or
ſacrifice of Chriſt, to the old Expiation obtained by the legall Prieſt.
By Redemption he underſtands expiation or deliverance from the guilt of
ſinnes. For to be guilty of ſinne, and thereupon bound over to death and
damnation is a grievous captivity and ſlavery. When he calls this Expiation
<hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> he tacitly gives a reaſon, why he ſaid before, that
Chriſt entred once only into the holy place; namely, becauſe by his
entrance and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of himſelfe he expiated or atoned men for ever; as it
is ſaid chap. 10.14 Chriſt therefore obtained an eternall redemption,
becauſe he hath fully expiated all the ſinnes not only paſt, but to come,
of all men beleeving in him, who have lived heretofore, or do now live, or
ſhall live hereafter to the worlds end. So that this expiation doth pertaine
to all ſinnes, of all times and of all men, who truly pertaine to Chriſt.
But the legall expiation performed yearly every yeare, did not extend to all
ſinnes, but only to Ignorances and Infirmities; nor to all times, not at all
to the time future, but only to the time paſt within the circuit of one year;
nor to all perſons, but only to thoſe who were then living when the
expiation was made; and therefore it was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, but only annuall. The
word <hi>having obtained,</hi> muſt not bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood preteritively, as
if Chriſt had obtained the redemption before he entred; but preſentively,
that he had obtained it by and upon his entrance; or when he entred then he
obtained. See what we explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before concerning indefinite participles,
Chap. 6. ver. 13.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>For if the bloud</hi>] Hee confirmes his former
aſſertion, That Chriſt by his one oblation of himſelfe hath obtained an
eternall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for us. And that he might compaſſe this the better, he
proves by an argument, <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> that Chriſt hath
purged away thoſe ſinnes that pollute our conſciences. For the
expurgation of theſe doth produce this effect, that laying aſide all
ſinne, we ſhall ſerve God ever after in all holineſſe and
righteouſneſſe: and if we doe this, wee ſhall need no further offering
for our ſinnes. As on the contrary, if we finally forſake not our ſinnes,
but after expiation of them relapſe into them againe (which wee then doe when
this expiation doth not ſo far prevaile with us, as to withdraw us from our
ſinnes) then we have need of another offering and ſacrifice, to obtaine
remiſſion of our relapſes. <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61860:87"/>For it ſtands not with
reaſon; that men ſhould be expiated with one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice, and yet be
ſtill enſlaved to the ſame ſinnes, and be nothing the better for their
expiation. Therefore either the expiation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent and of force to
withdraw men from ſinne, and make them live holily ever after; or elſe as
men alwayes returne to their ſinnes, ſo the expiation muſt be alwayes
iterated, and then it cannot bring eternall redemption to them. It is therefore
manifeſt, that the offering of Chriſt, ſeeing it is but one, can really
profit no man, but him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the faith of Chriſt, doth
ſhake off the yoke of ſinne, and wholly devote himſelfe to God, to live
in a holy courſe of life ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Of buls and goats</hi>] Hee calls
thoſe Bulls which in the former verſe he called Calves; as well for their
age being of a middle grouth between Calves and Bullocks, in which ſenſe
alſo a Heifer is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time put for a Cow; as by a ſynecdoche putting
either of theſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently for any beaſt of the herd, as oppoſed to
thoſe of the flocke which were goats or ſheep. For in the yearly
ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the whole people, to which the Authors words
refer; to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, there was no Bull ſlaine, but only an heifer
(or as our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on renders it, a Bullock) for the ſins of the
Prieſt, and a goat for the ſins of the people. And this is the reaſon why
the Author joynes theſe beaſts here, as likewiſe he doth it afterward,
Chap. 10.4. <hi>And the aſhes of an heifer, ſprinkling the unclean</hi>]
How the water of ſeperation was made of the aſhes of a burned heifer, and
ſprinkled upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; ſee Numb. 19. It is not neceſſary for the
concluding of the Authors argument, that the aſhes of the heifer ſhould be
put here for a type of the bloud of Chriſt; for the argument here is not
drawn from the type to the antitype (unleſſe it be accidentally) but from
termes of diſparity, and excellency of Chriſts offering. This we therefore
note, leſt any man ſhould thinke it might be gathered from hence, that the
Author compares this ſacrifice of Chriſt, with any other legall
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, beſides the anniverſarye, at which the high Prieſt entered
the moſt holy place. Although we willingly acknowledge, that thoſe aſhes
were a type of Chriſts bloud, and a moſt lively type; becauſe thoſe
aſhes were a kinde of perpetuity, and muſt alwayes bee in a
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, and had force at any time to cleanſe any perſon
ſprinkled therewith from his legall uncleanneſſes of the fleſh; and
this force or effect of it depended not on the pleaſure of any man, but only
from the decree of God alone. So the bloud of Chriſt is a perpetuall &amp;
ſtanding remedy, that hath force and power at any time to cleanſe men from
the guilt of their ſinnes, if they be truly ſprinkled with it, by being
waſhed from the filth of their ſinnes; <hi>i.</hi> if they caſt them off
for the time to come; and this force the bloud of Chriſt hath from the good
pleaſure of God. Theſe aſhes are ſaid to ſprinkle, not efficiently,
as if the action began at them, and they ſprinkled themſelves; but
inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally <pb n="170" facs="tcp:61860:88"/>becauſe the uncleane was ſprinkled
with the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were infuſed; as wee ſay, the ſword
woundeth, becauſe the ſword is the inſtrument wherewith the wound is
made. <hi>Sanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh.</hi>] To ſanctifie is
to cleanſe; for ſanctified is commonly oppoſed to polluted; as polluted
and common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly uſed, is eaſily polluted, and cannot be
cleane; ſeeing then a thing is cleane when it is ſeparated from ordinary
and common uſe. For this ſanctifying (as the word following ſhewes)
conſiſteth onely in purifying of the fleſh. All the ſanctifying that
proceeded from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the bloud of calves and goates, or from the
ſprinkling of the aſhes of an heifer, was but a carnall purifying to
cleanſe the fleſh. The Ceremoniall uncleanneſſes wherewith men by
chance were defiled, were expiated by theſe offerings and ſprinklings; and
the partie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled became purified; ſo that now it was lawfull for him to
converſe with other men, to come to the Temple, to be preſent at divine
ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and to partake of the Sacrifice; from all which his former
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe debarred him. So that this Puritie or cleanneſſe of the
fleſh, was both the end and effect of the offering of bloud and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of aſhes.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt</hi>]
Some man may think, that the Author ſhould not have drawne his argument
<hi>à mirori,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>à pari;</hi> ſeeing there
ſeemes an equalitie of reaſon on both ſides, that as well the legall
ſacrifice, as that of Chriſt had a like force to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their effects;
the blood of beaſts to purifie the fleſh, and the blood of Chriſt to
purifie the conſcience. But we muſt note, that the blood of beaſts and
the offering of it, is not altogether of like nature to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fleſh,
as the blood of Chriſt offered to God by the ſpirit, is to the cleanſing
of the conſcience: For if we looke upon the nature of the thing, what force
hath the blood of beaſts offered in the Sanctuary, that thereby it ſhould
cleanſe the fleſh, or be reputed to cleanſe it? Was not this effect of
purifying the fleſh, tyed to the ſhedding and offering of that blood; onely
by the decree of God? and that it might bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to have this effect,
muſt they not have a knowledge of Gods decree by ſome other meanes? But for
the blood of Chriſt, after the ſhedding of it, there followed the offering
of Chriſt himſelfe in the heavenly Tabernacle; or the ſhedding of
Chriſts blood joyned with the offering of Chriſt himſelfe (as the Author
conſiders the blood of Chriſt here) ſeeing Chriſt therefore ſhed it,
that hee might offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Sanctuary of heaven, both as a Prieſt
and as a Sacrifice; The blood of Chriſt, I ſay, if we reſpect the nature
of the thing, hath a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent force to purge our conſciences, or is the true
and effectuall cauſe of their being purged. For in the offering of Chriſt,
as wee have already ſaid ſomwhat, and more ſhall afterward, is contained
his ſingular and <pb n="171" facs="tcp:61860:88"/>onely care of our ſalvation in
heaven; from whence the purifying of our conſciences, and the plenary
remiſſion of our ſinnes, doth flow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as from the proper
cauſe of it. Furthermore, that the blood of Chriſt may be knowne to have
ſo great force, looking on the nature of Chriſts death, and the
circumſtances of it, every man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be admoniſhed of it; For
Chriſt by his blood did ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the truth of his doctrine;
having ſhed his blood he entred into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the habitacle of immortall
life, that what he had promiſed by his words hee might teſtifie to all men
by his example; having ſhed his blood and entered into his heavenly
Sanctuary, hee offered himſelfe an immaculate ſacrifice to God for us;
having ſhed his blood he obtained all power both in heaven and earth, all
judgement and arbitrement of our ſalvation. Neither to obtaine this was the
bloodſhed of Chriſt a bare condition, that of it owne nature and proper
efficacy conferred nothing to it: but ſeeing it conteineth ſo hard a worke
of vertue and obedience, a worke ſo acceptable to God, and ſo advancing to
his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even of it own nature it had force and power to procure this power
unto Chriſt, and to produce in us the cleanſing of our conſcience. Hee
that ponders all this in his minde, can he doubt, but that by the blood of
Chriſt he is expiated from all ſtaine of ſinne, if he embrace the faith
of Chriſt with all his heart, and afterward as farre as the hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life can encourage him, keep himſelfe undefiled and pure from all ſtaine of
ſinne? Thus the nature and force of Chriſts death being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the
Authour with very good reaſon doth draw and conclude this his argument, not
from a parity of reaſon but from a diſparity, or from the leſſe to the
greater. <hi>The blood of Chriſt</hi>] There ſeemes an Emphaſis in
theſe words of the Author, to make it yet more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, how great
force his blood hath in cleanſing our conſciences; As if he had ſaid, The
blood, not of an ordinary man, which yet is better then that of beaſts, but
of Chriſt, who is the unigenit ſon of God, feated in heaven at the right
hand of God, and reigning over all creatures: Shall not this blood have much
more force to purge the conſcience, then the blood of beaſts had to purifie
the fleſh? Now, that we may a little prevent the words of the Author, the
cleanſing of our conſcience is attributed to the blood of Chriſt, both as
it is the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby the new Covenant is eſtabliſhed,
and as it is the blood of the ſacrifice which is offered for us in that
heavenly Sanctuary; both which the Authour hath conjoyned, ſaving that he
explicates the firſt laſt, and the laſt firſt, becauſe it belongs to
his Prieſthood, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is referred to his Mediatorſhip; which two
functions of Chriſt were fitly conjoyned in the mention of his blood; for
they are both coupled in the death of Chriſt; for his Mediatorſhip ended in
his death, and his Prieſthood began there: But how the blood of Chriſt
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our conſciences, as it is the bloud of the Covenant, wee ſhall
ſee <pb n="172" facs="tcp:61860:89"/>hereafter. Yet now we ſhall adde thus much, that
the new Covenant was eſtabliſhed by the bloud of Chriſt, not onely as
appointed ſo by God, in manner as the bloud of calves and goates was of old
appointed for the eſtabliſhing of the old covenant: but even the very
nature and condition of his bloud, was of great efficacy thereto. For who can
doubt of the truth of that covenant, for confirmation whereof the bloud of
Chriſt was ſhed, who made this covenant in the name of God, and afterward
became our heavenly King? <hi>Who through the eternall Spirit offered
himſelfe without ſpot to God</hi>] Here the Author clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
by what meanes the bloud of Chriſt as it was the bloud of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
had ſo much power &amp; force as to purge our conſciences; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe Chriſt having ſhed his bloud, did through the eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
offer himſelf without ſpot to God in the heavenly Sanctuary. Hence it is
manifeſt, that the bloud of Chriſt had ſo far power to expiate our
ſins, as the ſhedding of it was ſeconded by Chriſt his offering of
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in heaven; which could not follow unleſſe Chriſt had firſt
ſhed his bloud: For the bloud of Chriſt, not onely as it is the bloud of
the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, takes efficacy and force to purge ſin from the ſubſequent
oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt in offering himſelfe in heaven: but alſo as it is the
bloud of the Covenant, it received great force from the ſubſequent
reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and glory of Chriſt. For the death of Chriſt is as it were
animated and quickned by his Reſurrection and glory, and then are the mightie
effects of it, when he that ſuffered death to confirm the new covenant, is
thereupon acknowledged to be the Sonne of God, and the Chriſt: which
certainly could not have been without his Reſurrection and the ſubſequent
glory of it. For then wee plainely perceive the boundleſſe love of God in
delivering Chriſt to death for us; and the boundleſſe love of Chriſt in
dying for us: from both which wee may eaſily draw an undoubted hope of our
ſalvation. And then alſo wee ſee from his moſt ſhamefull death, a
paſſage open to immortall life; and laſtly, then we eſteem the Covenant
moſt ſacred, that was confirmed by a death ſo precious. But if Chriſt
had not riſen from the dead, who therefore died that he might appear to be
the Chriſt, and the King over Gods people; his death had thereby loſt all
the force of it; yea, it would have been of force to nullifie the faith of all
his promiſes. But he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us eternal life in the Name of his
Father, and that he himſelf would give it us, by raiſing us from the dead;
yea, hee openly ſaid of himſelfe that he would riſe the third day,
thereby to confirm his doctine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unles the event had been
anſwerable, his doctrine had been ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all authority. But let us
returne to the offering of Chriſt, which the Author oppoſeth to the
offering of the old high Prieſt for ſeverall reſpects. 1. In that
Chriſt offered through the Spirit, and the eternall Spirit: but the high
Prieſt under the Law, did enter the Holy place, and offer through his
infirmitie; a weake man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed <pb n="173" facs="tcp:61860:89"/>with the fleſh.
But Chriſt was filled with the eternall Spirit, <hi>i.</hi> with the power of
God, which clarified him from all mortalitie, and made him eternall, ſubject
to no deſtruction. Now this Spirit ſeemes to be called eternall, not onely
becauſe it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſides in Chriſt, but becauſe it makes him to
become eternall. Of which Spirit, if Chriſt had been deſtitute, he could
not have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe in that heavenly Sanctuary, to have remained there
for ever. Therefore in theſe words, (about which Interpreters have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
diſputes, as men muſt needs do, when the genuine ſence of any place is
either not perceived or not allowed) is expreſſed the cauſe, how Chriſt
being before not onely of a mortall nature and compaſſed with fleſh, but
alſo ſlaine as a ſacrifice, could afterward enter the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Sanctuary, the palace of immortality, and there as a Prieſt offer himſelfe
to God. This he ſaith was effected by the benefit of the eternall Spirit, who
throughly conſecrated Chriſt, and deveſted him from all naturall and
terrene infirmities. That which hee had ſpoken before, chap. 7. ver. 16. that
Chriſt was made a Prieſt after the power of an endleſſe life; now hee
ſaith againe in other words, that Chriſt offered through the eternall
Spirit; for if wee looke into the thing it ſelfe, what is the power of an
endleſſe life, other then this eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? In a like manner Paul
treating of Chriſt, as he is ordained and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Son of God with power
by the reſurrection from the dead, <hi>i.</hi> as God after his
reſurrection made him the celeſtiall and eternall King of his people with
ſupreme power, mentions the Spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſanctification,
Rom. 1.4. and he ſaith, that Chriſt was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Sonne of God
according to the Spirit of holineſſe as he was made of the ſeed of David
according to the fleſh. For, ſeeing he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this Spirit to the
fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>i.</hi> to whatſoever was humane in his nature, what
can he elſe underſtand, but the power of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit powred upon Chriſt,
which aboliſhing from him all his mortall condition, did throughly
conſecrate him unto God, made him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt divine, and moſt like
unto God in nature and power, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him fully capable of a celeſtiall
and eternall kingdome? Hither alſo muſt that of Peter be referred, where he
ſaith, (as it is in the Greek) that Chriſt was mortified in the fleſh,
but vivified by the Spirit, 1 Pet. 3.18. where as the fleſh of Chriſt is
made the cauſe of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and conſequently of his death: ſo is
the Spirit, (namely of God in Chriſt) made the ſpring and fountaine of his
vivification or life. 2. He oppoſeth the offering of Chriſt to that of the
old high Prieſt, in that Chriſt offered himſelfe; but the Legall Prieſt
offered not himſelfe, but the bloud of ſlaine beaſts: but what force
could that bloud have being offered and ſprinkled before the Mercy-ſeate
for the purifying of the fleſh, if we reſpect the nature of the thing? But
Chriſt himſelfe being offered for us in the heavenly Tabernacle, was he not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61860:90"/>a moſt acceptable ſacrifice to God? Is there any ſin
of thoſe that are truly faithfull in Chriſt, which by the offering of ſo
holy a Sacrifice, and by the authority and care of ſo great an high Prieſt
with his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father could not be expiated? 3. In that hee offered
himſelfe without ſpot or blemiſh. For the old ſacrifice muſt bee very
pure and free from any ſpot; wherefore ſeeing our high Prieſt himſelfe
was the ſacrifice, hee muſt needs bee void of all ſpot or blemiſh. But
the old high Prieſt when he entered the moſt holy place and offered, was
not without ſpot or blemiſh; for even then he was to procure the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no leſſe of his owne ſins then of the peoples. But Chriſt when he
entered the heavenly Sanctuary, and offered himſelfe to God, was then free
from all ſpot, not onely in reſpect of his moſt innocent life, which he
paſſed without the leaſt ſpot of ſinne; but alſo, which as wee
ſaid in the ſeventh Chapter, the Author chiefly reſpecteth, in reſpect
of his immortall nature; which he obtained free from all ſpot of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he was quickned with that eternall Spirit, whereby he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the
heavenly Sanctuary. But what is meant by this offering of Chriſt, wee have
declared before. For theſe things are not properly ſpoken of Chriſt: but
onely comparatively and alluſively to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent high Prieſt. So that by
this offering of Chriſt is ſignified, his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and onely care for
the expiation of our ſins, and for our ſalvation. Yet it is a care worthy
and ſutable to ſo great an high Prieſt, who is not deſtitute of power
in himſelfe to conferre ſalvation upon us, but is forced to obtaine it from
another, as the old high Prieſt was: but is one, that enjoyeth all command
both in heaven and earth, one that exerciſeth all Judgement delivered over
unto him from his Father; and one that by his owne proper power doth releaſe
us from all guilt of our ſins, frees us from all puniſhment, and laſtly
makes us capable of eternall life. Whence it ſo much the more appeares, how
the purging of our conſciences doth certainely follow upon the bloud and
death of Chriſt, and upon his ſubſequent offering in heaven. <hi>Purge
your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
workes</hi>] How much more <hi>ſhall</hi> the bloud of Chriſt
<hi>purge?</hi> Shall is ſo the future tenſe here, that it carries the
force of the time preſent. For, in ſuch arguments drawne from compariſon,
wee love to uſe the future tenſe in the conſequent member of it. If this
be ſo, much more ſhall that. For herein we reſpect not any futurity of
time, but a futurity of conſequence and of truth; for many times wee conclude
in that manner of things paſt. The conſcience here is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the
fleſh; for as the bloud of beaſts offered did purge the fleſh, ſo the
bloud of Chriſt offered through the Spirit, doth penetrate unto the
conſcience and purge it. And ſinnes are called dead workes, not formally as
if they had no life or activity in them: but effectively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are
deadly works, that brings death to the ſinner, and of their owne nature keepe
the ſinner dead for ever. Theſe deadly works <pb n="175" facs="tcp:61860:90"/>are the
ſpots and blots that defile our conſcience; and from theſe our
conſcience is purged by the bloud of Chriſt; not onely in that we are freed
from the guilt of them in the ſight of God, and conſequently from all
puniſhment of them; but alſo in that wee are delivered from the ſence of
that guilt, and from the feare of puniſhment, and ſo our conſcience is
caſed of a grievous burden. And it was not for nothing that the Author would
rather ſay, purge <hi>our conſcience,</hi> then our <hi>minde,</hi> the
inward part of us, oppoſite to the fleſh; Becauſe thereby he would
ſhew, that the bloud of Chriſt doth alſo cleanſe away, that miſery
and torment of the conſcience, whereby men conſcious of their
wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doe tremble and quake for feare of Gods Judgements. This is
moſt certaine, that true and ſolid peace of conſcience in them that have
ſinned, doth ground it ſelfe upon this, that God hath declared his will,
they ſhould be free from all the guilt of their ſinnes; And yet it may be,
that men freed in the ſight of God from the guilt of their ſinnes, may not
enjoy a peaceable and quiet conſcience, becauſe they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of
the knowledge or faith of it. Therefore the bloud of Chriſt offered to God
through the eternall Spirit, doth not onely aboliſh all the guilt of our
ſinnes, but alſo doth certifie and make faith thereof unto us; as we heard
before. Whence it commeth to paſſe that there ariſeth a great calme and
quiet of conſcience in their minds, who have taſted the efficacy and vertue
of Chriſt his bloud and ſacrifice; and we may well ſay that though
formerly their conſcience were oppreſſed with many crimes; yet then their
conſcience is wholly disburdened, and they finde no guiltineſſe in it.
And this is the ſcope which God propoſed unto himſelfe in the death of
Chriſt and the things following thereon. For he would not therefore binde
himſelfe by the bloud of Chriſt and eſtabliſh a new Covenant, becauſe
there might be danger, that he would not ſtand to his promiſes who is
moſt true and faithfull of his word; but becauſe we ſhould want no
aſſurance of his grace and mercy towards us. And hence alſo it is, that
when Chriſt was raiſed from the dead and inveſted with immortality, God
exalted him into heaven, and committed unto him the whole care and arbitrement
of our ſalvation. For the efficacy and force of Chriſts death and the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents upon it, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from their ſcope whereat
God aymed; although that efficacy were ſubſervient to this ſcope, and
effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to the compaſſing of it. The efficacy of Chriſts death and
the conſequents upon it, was very great, both to obliege God to performe his
promiſes, and to produce the reall effect of them upon us: but the ſcope
is, (as we have ſaid) to make aſſured and undoubted faith unto us, of
ſo great grace of God, of ſo great ſalvation and remiſſion of ſins;
to the end that wee being fully certified thereof, might againe on our part
performe our duty, and wholly devote our ſelves to God. Whence the Author
adding afterward this end or effect of purging our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61860:91"/>to be performed by us on our part, doth thereby teach us,
that in this purging of our conſcience he included, not only an Immunity from
puniſhmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, ariſing from the
aboliſhing of our guilt before God, but alſo a ſecurity from them,
proceeding from our certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that our guilt is aboliſhed. Now for
the matter of our Impunity or freedome from puniſhment; our puniſhment is
not only temporall, but alſo eternall, oppoſite to life eternall. From the
puniſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death, thoſe ſacrifices

                  </gap> the Law were ſo farre from
freeing any man, that they could exempt no man from temporall death, or
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall puniſhment, for they only tooke away ſome other light penalties
or inconveniences of this life. Neither did God write all his Lawes in bloud,
ordaining death for every offence; but moderated the rigor of his Law with
ſingular juſtice and equity. Upon ſome offences hee laid the penalty of
death, which no ſacrifice could releaſe; upon others he laid a fine and a
ſacrifice. The mulct or fine was to bee paid to the party grieved; but the
ſacrifice to himſelfe, for thereupon he remitted the penalty due to
himſelfe; but would have reſtitution made of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to man. So
for example for theft, the penalty was a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the double, triple or
quadruple, to be paid to the party thereby damaged: but beſides this
reſtitution, the theft was expiated by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was inſtead of a
penalty to the moſt mercifull God. Laſtly, there ſome things totally void
of all true offence: as for example, if any man had touched a dead body, though
it were of duty to bury him (which was rather a matter of piety then of
offence) yet becauſe this and other ſuch like caſes were condemned by the
Law of uncleannes, therefore they were to be expiated either by ſome
ſacrifice, or by the holy water of ſeparation. Therefore all the uſe of
thoſe ſacrifices was to expiate ſome lighter faults or uncleanneſſes
of the fleſh; but great offences were puniſhed with death. Hence David
acknowledging his ſinne exiable by no ſacrifices of beaſts, ſaith to
God, Thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not ſacrifices, elſe would I give them: but thou
delighteſt not in burn: offerings, Pſal. 51.16. He means in the expiation
of ſuch crimes as his was; and therefore he flyes to the ſole mercy and
clemency of God; and reſolves to pacifie God with the ſacrifice of a broken
and contrite heart. The force of which ſacrifice, if it be made
ſeaſonably, and abound afterward in the fruits of good workes, is
eſtabliſhed and ratified by the Law of the Goſpel. Now the bloud and
ſacrifice of Chriſt takes away all guilt and penalties of all ſins, even
of the moſt heynous, in them who having taſted the force of that
ſacrifice, do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward live holily: I ſay, all kind of penalties not only
of temporall death but of eternall, which by force of the law all incurred,
that had truly and morally ſinned. For temporall life oppoſed to temporal
death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the obſervation of the Law otherwiſe, then eternall
life did oppoſed to eternall death. For to attain or preſerve temporall
life it <pb n="177" facs="tcp:61860:91"/>ſufficed to keep the Law taken in an open and
literall ſeaſe (as they call it) and to expiate certain offences by certain
rites and ſacrifices. But the latter could no man attaine by force of the
Law, unleſſe a man had kept the precepts of it, taken in a myſticall
ſenſe. <hi>i.</hi> moſt fully and perfectly as the Goſpell propoſeth
them. For ſeeing eternall life was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the promiſes of the
Law, but in a myſticall ſenſe; it was great equity, that he who would
attaine it by the benefit of the Law, ſhould likewiſe keep the precepts of
the Law in a myſticall ſenſe. Neither only ſo; but it muſt be kept
exactly, and without any ſinne: ſo that there ſhould need no ſacrifices
or expiations. For no ſacrifices were of ſuch force as to take away the
guilt of eternall death; and ſo eſtate a man in a right to eternall life;
neither did the Law open any other way to arrive at a plenary juſtification
joyned with the reward of eternall life, then by the merit of workes. <hi>To
ſerve the living God</hi>] Here is the effect of this Expiation wrought in us
by the bloud and offering of Chriſt. For when our conſcience doth clearly
acknowledge, that in reſpect of God, it is freed from all guilt of all
ſinne even the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and nothing can hinder us but our ſelves,
from enjoying the reall effect of our being acquitted from all ſinne; it
comes to paſſe here by that we muſt needs have ſtrong motives to carry
us on to the worſhip and ſervice of God, and to receive the faith of
Chriſt; to the end wee may effectually enjoy ſo great a bleſſing, and
having once enjoyed it never loſe it, but afterward abſtaine from all
ſinne with all our poſſible endeavour, knowing well that ſo great a
bleſſing is attained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with true piety. Hence it appeares
that this purging of our conſcience gotten by the bloud of Chriſt, muſt
be ſo underſtood in this place, that for the reall effect of it, it depends
upon our duty on our part; <hi>i.</hi> then it begins to have it effect in us,
when our faith and obedience begins toward God and Chriſt; and is continued
by the continuance of our faith and obedience, and by conſtancie and
perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in faith and godlineſſe to the end, is at length
conſummated, and doth reſt in a full and immutable right to eternall life,
the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will moſt certainly follow in due time. For unleſſe
this effect and complement of our expiation depend reciprocally upon our duty,
and our duty and will to ſerve God flowed immediatly from it, what one man
among a thouſand would ſerve God upon the expiation of his finnes, if he
knew that without this, he could be expiated effectually, and releaſed from
the guilt of all his ſinnes, and enjoy a full right to eternall life?
becauſe therefore this offering of Chriſt doth withdraw us from ſinne,
and makes us afterward ſerve the living God; hence it comes to paſſe,
that Chriſt doth expiate us by one only offering, or that our expiation
flowing from the offering and ſacrifice of Chriſt is eternall and laſteth
forever. For what need the offering be iterated, if men once expiated, ſinne
no more? For although ſometime by error <pb n="178" facs="tcp:61860:92"/>or infirmity the
true worſhippers of God may offend; yet becauſe the offering of Chriſt
doth not ſo properly intend to expiate ſuch light of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as ſinnes
that are more heynous; as appears by the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the new Covenant, as
it ſtands diſtinguiſhed from the old; therefore the oblation of Chriſt
muſt not be iterated for our light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and lapſes. Therefore for
the removing of the guilt of ſuch light offences, the perpetuall reſidence
of Chriſt our high Prieſt in his heavenly Sanctuary, and his
interceſſion to his Father for us, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient; ſo that
for them he need not ſhed his bloud againe, and after the ſhedding of it
enter into his Sanctuary. The word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not alwayes ſignifie all kind of obedience and ſervice
done unto God, but chiefly that divine ſervice done to God publikly &amp;
moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as hath before been ſhewed, thoſe holy reverences which
we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in the worſhip of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet the Author uſeth it here by a
Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, for all divine ſervice that is joyned with the worſhip of God;
for worſhip and ſervice are mutuall adjuncts connexed each to other. For
ſo great a benefit of God as the expiation of all our ſins ſhould
eaſily move us to perform divine ſervices unto God, by praiſes and
thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and wholly to devote out ſelves to worſhip to good a God;
for then we take courage to approach unto God to worſhip and ſerve him, and
to hope that the honour we do him will not be unacceptable unto him, when we
feel our conſcience clean &amp; quiet, as purged from all ſin. Or elſe
the word here is taken by way of Metaphor, whereby all good works pleaſing
unto God and done for his ſake, are accounted for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and offerings
acceptable to God; and that wholy endeavours them may fitly be ſaid to
ſerve God. God is here called the living God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary
phraſe of Scripture; which notwithſtanding in this place wants not an
emphaſis: Not only becauſe hereby the true God is diſtinguiſhed from
all the feigned gods of the Gentiles, which becauſe they were nothing but
woodden or ſtony Idols, and therefore woodden and ſtony gods, were called
vaine and liveleſſe gods, and are oppoſed to the living God. But alſo
to ſhew the cauſe, why we ſhould worſhip and ſerve God, and withall
the happineſſe of thoſe that devote themſelves unto him. For ſeeing
hee is the living God, hee is alſo the true God, who can reward his
worſhippers and ſervitors with great benefits, and recompence them with
fearfull judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments who neglect him. To this end Paul writing to the
Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians ſaith, Yee are turned from Idols to God, to ſerve the
living and true God, 1 Theſſ. 1.9. And the word there is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies to
ſerve. And God is eminently called the living God, not only becauſe he
truly lives, but alſo becauſe he is the fountaine of life to all other
things which do live. In which ſenſe ſometimes, hee alone is ſaid to
live, or to have life and immortality in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And for this cauſe</hi>] Here the Author
confirmes his former aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion <pb n="179" facs="tcp:61860:92"/>by a new argument, in
that Chriſt is the Mediatour of the new Teſtament, or that Chriſt made
the New Teſtament and ſealed it with his bloud. For this is the nature of
the New Teſtament (as we ſhewed in the former Chapter) to containe the
remiſſion of all our ſinnes, even the moſt heinous, and conſequently
to be of force to purge our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And becauſe it is a Teſtament,
therefore it was firſt to be confirmed by death, which here neither can nor
muſt be any other then the death of Chriſt. Whence it is manifeſt that
the death or bloud of Chriſt, as it confirmes the New Teſtament, doth purge
our conſcience from dead workes. The particle <hi>and</hi> ſhews that a new
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is alledged; and the words <hi>for this cauſe</hi> note the finall
cauſe, for which Chriſt died. <hi>He is the Mediatour of the New
Teſtament.</hi>] Wee now uſe the word Teſtament and not Covenant,
becauſe the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly
ſignifies a Teſtament and not a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (though ſacred Writers uſe it
to ſignifie alſo a Covenant.) And the ambiguity of the word did well
ſerve the Author to draw his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from that which muſt needs be done
in a Teſtament. And to ſpeake a little yet more accurately, Teſtament and
Covenant differ but alternly, as <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies.</hi> For
every Teſtament is a Covenant, though not <hi>è contra;</hi> for
though the heire doe not covenant with the Teſtator at the making of the
Teſtament, becauſe that may be done altogether without his knowledge, which
is neceſſarily required in him that covenanteth: Yet he covenants at the
validity of the Teſtament; for when the Covenant takes effect by his
acceptance of the condition ſpecified in the Teſtament, and by his entrance
upon the Inheritance, then (though before he were free) he covenants <hi>ex
Lege,</hi> to performe the will of the Teſtatour. So that every Teſtament
at leaſt when it is conſummate and valid, is a kinde of Covenant; and it is
the beſt kinde of Covenant; 1. Becauſe it is moſt ſolemnely teſtified
by ſealing and witneſſing, from whence it is called a Teſtament. 2.
Becauſe it is moſt preciouſly confirmed, even by death, and the death of
him that makes it, who eſtabliſheth his owne deed by his owne death. 3.
Becauſe it containes an extraordinary benefit, in conveying the Teſtators
inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and whole eſtate to the heire. And laſtly, becauſe it
proceeds with the greateſt freedome, in leaving the heire to his liberity,
whether he will accept of the Inheritance or not. Now this New Teſtament is
the laſt will of God, which muſt ſtand for ever, becauſe it is already
confirmed, and therefore cannot be revoked. But how Chriſt is the Mediatour
of it hath beene partly ſhewed before, chap. 8.6. and is partly to be
ſhewed afterward; yet his Mediatorſhip conſiſteth chiefly in theſe
two acts, firſt in declaring or publiſhing it, and then in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or
eſtabliſhing it by his death, as a Teſtament ought to be. <hi>That by
meane, of death for the tranſgreſsions that were under the firſt
Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternall
inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>] <pb n="180" facs="tcp:61860:93"/>Here is a file of finall cauſes
linked one to another, whereof the laſt end is, the obtaining of an eternall
inheritance; the intermean is the redemption for the tranſgreſſions which
were under the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the prime Mean to theſe two former
ſubordinate ends whereby they are ſucceſſively atrained, is death,
which in a Teſtament muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily intervene. Hence we may ſee,
that the redemption of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions doth properly depend and flow from
the New Teſtament; and the death of Chriſt doth give force and ſtrength
to this Teſtament. The word Redemption is put for Expiation, as was ſhewed
ver. 12. For Expiation is one kinde or ſort of Redemption; both becauſe the
effect of expiation is a delivery, and becauſe alſo the meanes or it
whereby it is wrought is an expence, for it commonly coſteth bloud. Hence
ſome Tranſlators in this place render it <hi>Expiation.</hi> But becauſe
the word Redemption carries the ſenſe of Expiation, therefore it both
followes the conſtruction of it, and is ſimply called the redemption of
tranſgreſſions; either for their expiation, as wee have ſaid. In which
ſenſe the Scripture ſpeakes elſwhere. For Prov 16.6. where the vulgar
Latine reads it, By truth iniquity is redeemed; there our Engliſh
tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation hath it, By truth iniquity is purged, <hi>i.</hi> expiated; Or
for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from tranſgreſſions. For Cicero himſelfe in a ſenſe
not unlike, ſaith, <hi>Liberationem culpa,</hi> for <hi>à

culpâ.</hi> And he uſeth the word Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, whereby
grievous ſinnes are commonly ſignified, to ſhew us, what ſinnes chiefly
are remitted in the New Teſtament; namely, heynous and grievous ſinnes; for
which in the Old Teſtament there was no expiation allowed, but the
puniſhment of death impoſed. Wherefore he addeth, <hi>Which were under the
firſt Teſtament</hi>] He means which remained in force, or could not be
expiated, or for which no remiſſion was allowed under the Law. But hee
ſeems withall to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that thoſe grievous ſinnes had their being,
and were wont to bee committed under the Old Teſtament; whereas the New
Teſtament together with their guilt, doth wholly take away their being, in
them who cordially beleeve the promiſes of it. For that this is the force and
effect of the New Teſtament, and of the bloud of Chriſt, we have already
ſhewed, partly in the eight Chapter, and partly here. And he mentions not the
expiation of tranſgreſſions only or grievous ſins ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if
under the New Teſtament alſo all lighter ſins were not expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: but it
is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>Yea even of thoſe tranſgreſsions
under, &amp;c.</hi>] For ſomtimes the Scripture ſpeaketh ſimply, not to
exclude other things, but to teach us, that thoſe other things wherof there
might be greater doubt are included, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being thoght included, much
more is it to be thought ſo of the reſt. So Pſal. 25.8. David ſaith of
God, <hi>That he is good and upright, therefore wil he teach ſinners in the
way, i.</hi> Yea even ſinners, and not righteous men only, though he will
teach them alſo, and much rather; for ſo he preſently addes in the
verſe following, <hi>The <pb n="181" facs="tcp:61860:93"/>meeke will he guide in
judgement and teach his way.</hi> So Paul, Rom. 4.5. ſaith, <hi>That God
juſtifieth the ungodly;</hi> not that he juſtifieth him onely, but that hee
is ſo gracious as to juſtifie him alſo. Or elſe the Authour mentions
only tranſgreſſions, or grievous ſins, to ſhew that they chiefly are
expiated under the new Teſtament, and that this is the proper fruit of the
new Teſtament, and of the oblation of Chriſt. But if the guilt of grievous
ſins be taken away under the new Teſtament, much more muſt it be true of
lighter ſinnes. Beſides, grievous ſins do much more grieve the
conſcience then lighter; for to lighter ſinnes there was ſome expiation
granted in the law, whereby men might imagine that God of his infinite goodnes,
would alſo releaſe the penalty of eternall death; but to the other no
expiation was allowed. <hi>Might receive the promiſe.</hi> To receive the
promiſe of eternall inheritance, doth in this place ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, to enter the
reall poſſeſſion of the eternall inheritance which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
promiſed; and not to receive the promiſe of it onely. Therefore thoſe
grievous ſinnes whereof men ſtood guiltie, and for which they were
ſubject to eternall death, muſt firſt be expiated, before they can enter
and receive the eternall inheritance. For thoſe ſinnes did hinder men from
entring it; which being purged away, now nothing hinders, but they may take
poſſeſſion of it. But who ſhall do this? ſhall all
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly? no certainly, but <hi>they which are called</hi>].
<hi>i.</hi> They to whom this eternal inheritance is offered by the Goſpel of
Chriſt, and who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this great grace of God by a lively faith? For both
of theſe uſe to be included in the word <hi>called.</hi> But he ſimply
ſaith, they which are called might receive this eternall inheritance;
becauſe all which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led may receive it, if they will, and be not
wanting to themſelves; for in God and Chriſt there is no let.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo
of neceſsitie be the death of the Teſtator.</hi>] Here he gives the cauſe
why he ſaid, that by meanes of death, this effect of remiſſion of
ſinnes, and receiving the eternall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance doth follow; becauſe
(ſaith he) where a Teſtament is, there of neceſſity the death of the
Teſtator muſt intervene, which reaſon hee confirmes by a Super-reaſon
in the verſe following. But here ſome man may object, that the Author doth
but ſophiſticate with words, and not draw a reall argument from the thing
it ſelfe. Seeing Chriſt was not the Author of any teſtament properly, but
onely the Mediatour of the Covenant; although the Greeke writers uſe the word
Teſtament to ſignifie a Covenant: But the ambiguity of the word, muſt not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the natures and properties of the things; ſo that what is true of
one thing which the ambiguous word ſignifies, ſhould forthwith bee
transfered to the other, ſignified by the ſame word. We anſwer, That the
ſpeech is here of ſuch a thing, as is common to both the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the word, the proper and improper, or rather the generall, and the
ſpeciall; <hi>i.</hi> that is Covenant, and Teſtament, for we ſaid
before, <pb n="182" facs="tcp:61860:94"/>that every Teſtament is a Covenant, an
eſpeciall and beſt kind of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. For Covenant is a generall name
whereby thoſe things are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that are more properly named leagues and
teſtaments; both which are Covenants: And indeed, almoſt throughout the old
teſtament, the originall word which our Engliſh tranſlation renders
<hi>Covenant,</hi> doth properly ſignifie a <hi>League,</hi> and were better
ſo rendered; for becauſe God is a publike perſon, and ſo is mankinde
alſo, therefore all Gods Covenants with man are properly Leagues. Hence the
Latine tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both vulgar and others, conſtantly render them
<hi>Faedera.</hi> So for a teſtament, if we conſider the nature of it
accuratly, then any ſolemne act of any perſon teſtified by his death is
properly a teſtament; and he who teſtifies anothers act, though he be no
Author, but onely the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of it, is properly the teſtator of it.
For hence the Civilians have borrowed their termes of Teſtament and
Teſtator, which commonly concurre in the ſame perſon; yet not
neceſſarily, but accidentally: for whatſoever witneſſe will
teſtifie, upon his death, the verity and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of another mans laſt
Will and Teſtament, ſuch a witneſſe is truely a teſtator to that
Teſtament. And he that mediats to certifie a mans Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and mediats
ſo farre as to teſtifie it with his death, hee is both the mediator and the
teſtator of that Teſtament: ſo that a mediator and a teſtator, in
reſpect of the ſame Teſtament, are not functions incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, but
conſentaneous, that may eaſily concurre in the ſame perſon. Yea, hee
that in this ſence is the teſtator of a Teſtament, is neceſſarily
thereupon the mediator of it. So that Gods two ſolemne Covenants, or rather
his Leagues, the old and the new, are truely and properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Teſtaments;
becauſe they are both teſtified by bloud and death, to certifie, confirme,
and eſtabliſh them; for the old Teſtament was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the bloud
and death of calves and goates, which was therefore called the bloud of the
Teſtament, as it is declared in the verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. But becauſe the
new Teſtament was teſtified, certified, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and eſtabliſhed, by
the death and bloud of Chriſt, therefore Chriſt, though hee were not the
Author of it, yet is moſt truely and properly the teſtator of it. And
becauſe Chriſt did mediate for this Teſtament, to certifie and publiſh
it to the world, that the old and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer teſtament was abrogated and
revoaked, and that this new one was the laſt Will and Teſtament of his
Father: therefore alſo be was moſt truely and properly the Mediatour of it.
And hee was ſo conſtant and earneſt a Mediator, to certifie the truth of
this new Teſtament, that thereupon hee became the teſtator of it alſo, to
teſtifie and confirme it with his death and blood. Nay, becauſe Chriſt
was the Teſtator of it, therefore hee muſt neceſſarily alſo be the
Mediator of it; for no man will teſtifie that truth or that cauſe with his
bloud, for which he no way mediats; ſeeing he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat no way mediats for a thing,
will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> teſtifie it with his
blood. Wherefore in the words of theſe 16. and 17 verſes, 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61860:94"/>though the Author for a while ſuppoſeth, and takes it
for graunted, that not onely death, but the death of the Teſtator (which here
is Chriſt) muſt needs intervene to confirme the new Teſtament; yet a
little after at the 23. verſe, and ſo forward, hee clearly demonſtrats
it. For there he teacheth, that the matter muſt not, nor could not be
effected by the bloud of beaſts; becauſe he was both the Mediator and the
high Prieſt of the Covenant or League; who when he was to appeare before God
in his heavenly Sanctuary, and there to performe his offering, certainly he was
not to ſlay ſome beaſt, to bring the bloud of it into that Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary:
but muſt ſhed his own bloud, to make himſelfe his owne offering in
heauen; thereby to confirme and eſtabliſh the new League or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
which as he might do, ſo he muſt doe it, for the great dignity and
ſublimity of the particulars therein contained. So that in this reſpect the
new Covenant comes neerer to the nature of a Teſtament, then of a League,
which was the proper nature of the old Covenant. For what effect could there be
in the bloud of a beaſt, to confirme and make faith unto us of heavenly
promiſes? Such a Confirmation had very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed this divine and
heavenly Covenant, eſpecially ſeeing it might be confirmed by other bloud
more ſutable to it, and by bloud that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was to be ſhed for
another cauſe; which cauſe hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been ſhewed at the 14. verſe.
Whence wee may perceive, that in theſe words in this 16. verſe, as they are
alſo extended to Covenants or Leagues, and to the Authors and Mediators of
them, ſomthing muſt be underſtood to make the truth of them fully to
appeare, which yet is not expreſſed, becauſe it makes nothing to the
point in hand. For theſe words of the Author here muſt be taken, as it he
had ſaid, where a Teſtament is, there muſt needs bee the death of the
Teſtator, or at leaſt (as in leagues which in a manner reſemble
Teſtaments) the death of ſome creature, whereby the League is confirmed by
him that makes it; for till death intervene, a Teſtament or League, is of no
force and ſtrength: which exception, or rather which correction of his
generall ſaying, why it was not added here, the cauſe hath been already
ſhewed. We may alſo anſwer the former objection thus. That his
reaſoning here is comparative by way of ſimilitude, not explicitely, but
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly as is ofen uſed. And the words are to be taken, as if he had
ſaid; as when a Teſtament is made, the death of the Teſtator muſt needs
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede; becauſe it muſt be animated by the death of the Teſtator; for
while the Teſtator lives, the Teſtament lives not, or is not in force: So
alſo when the new League or Teſtament was ordained, his death muſt accede
that made it, and was in ſtead of the Teſtator, that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might
be firme and of force. For though Chriſt made not the new Teſtament as the
Author or principall agent of it, yet becauſe hee was the Mediator, and
inſtrument of his Father to ſpeed it in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, therefore he may
be ſaid to have made it; for wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61860:95"/>attribute the
ſame action both to the agent who is the prime cauſe of it, and to the
Inſtrument who is the means of it. From hence it manifeſtly appears, what
force the bloud of Chriſt hath in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us remiſſion of ſinnes;
namely theſe, two forces; firſt that by it the New Teſtament was
eſtabliſhed or confirmed; and ſecondly, that thereupon he offered
himſelfe to God for us in heaven. So that his bloud was confirmatory to
ſettle the eternall inheritance upon us; and expiatory to procure an eternall
redemption of our ſinnes: whereof the former is handled in this verſe, the
latter in thoſe precedent. Why Chriſt is called here the Teſtator, we
have before ſufficiently reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; namely, becauſe he was the maine
witneſſe to certifie the truth of the Teſtament by his death; and
becauſe he was the maine party by whoſe death the Teſtament which till
then lay dead, became alive and valid to be of force and effect. Yet here wee
ſhall adde one reaſon more, becauſe it will ſerve wondrouſly to
annimate our faith and love toward Chriſt; and that is, becauſe the
inheritance conveyed unto us by this New Teſtament, is properly the
inheritance of Chriſt; for hee is the <hi>unigenit</hi> or only begotten
Sonne of God, and was ordained to be Lord and heire of all his Fathers
eſtate; and hath admitted us that will accept of it, to be co-heires and
fellow-partners with him in it; and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Teſtator to ſettle the
poſſeſſion of it upon us. Or to ſpeake in the words of Paul, <hi>He
hath received us to the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 15.7. And the words of Chriſt
to his Diſciples tend to this ſenſe. <hi>I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

mee,</hi> Luke 22.29.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>For a teſtament is of force after men are
dead</hi>] This is the reaſon why the death of the teſtator muſt accede
to the teſtament hee hath made, becauſe all the while the teſtator lives,
his teſtament is dead and of no force to give any poſſeſſion to the
heire of the inheritance and eſtate thereby to be conveyed: but when the
teſtator is dead then the teſtament takes life and becomes of force; for
then the heire hath an actuall right and power to enter upon the inheritance.
And therefore he addes, <hi>Otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, while
the teſtator liveth.</hi> Theſe are the ſame words in effect with the
former, and are but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from them, by that rule of reaſoning
which we call conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by contrapoſition. For if a teſtament be of
force when the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is dead; then it muſt needs follow, that while the
teſtator is not dead, the teſtament is of no force. Which kinde of
reaſoning is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture; yet among many paſſages we ſhall
inſtance but in this one, and in this the rather, becauſe the texts of it
are much obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Interpreters, who labour to reconcile them, as if they
ſeemed oppoſite; whereas no two texts can be more according, for they are
wholly equipollent, and each conſequent to the other. Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me,</hi> Mat. 12.30. and he ſaith
againe, <pb n="185" facs="tcp:61860:95"/>He that is not againſt us, is for us; or which
is all one, <hi>He that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, is with me,</hi> Luke 9.50. This
latter ſaying in Luke is ſo farre from being oppoſite or contrary to the
former in Matthew, that it is a moſt immediate and neceſſary
conſequence from it. For if this ſaying be true as it is, becauſe the
truth hath ſaid it, <hi>He that is not with Chriſt, is againſt him.</hi>
Then this alſo from thence muſt needs follow for a truth, <hi>He that is
not againſt Chriſt, is with him.</hi> Becauſe this latter ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is
the converſion of the former by contrapoſition.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Whereupon neither the firſt was dedicated
without bloud</hi>] What he had ſaid before in generall of teſtaments, now
he declares in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and proves by an example in the firſt or Old
Teſtament, and makes way for himſelfe to apply the ſame unto Chriſt,
and to the New Teſtament eſtabliſhed by him. For becauſe under the Old
Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it ſelfe was confirmed by bloud; and becauſe almoſt all
things were cleanſed by bloud, at leaſt ſinnes could not be cleanſed
without ſhedding of bloud: Therefore from hence, he gathers by way of
ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, that death and ſhedding of bloud muſt needs intervene under
the New Teſtament, that thereby both the Teſtament it ſelfe might be
confirmed, and our ſinnes purged. <hi>Was ded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; which as Interpreters note is
properly ſaid, when ſome ſolemne act is done, whereby a new thing being
perfected and finiſhed, begins to come in uſe. So the Conſecration of
Solomons new Temple, was called the Dedication of it; and the Conſecration of
the new Altar erected by Judas Maccabeus was called the Dedication of it, 1
Maccab. 4.56. And the annuall celebration of that dedication is called the
feaſt of the dedication. John 10.22. yet this word applied to leagues,
ſignifies nothing elſe but to confirme them. And leagues are then
confirmed, when they are ſo ratified, as thereby they have force and
ſtrength to become obligatory and binding to all parties therein
intereſſed. For the confirmation of a league, is ſome ſolemne act done
by the confederates, or in their name, whereby they mutually ſo binde their
faith, that it ſhall not bee lawfull for either party to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinde or
revoke the league. And although there bee many formes of confirmation for
leagues, yet anciently the uſuall forme was by bloud, and that of the Old
Teſtament was performed by the bloud of beaſts: Wherefore with good
reaſon, the Author ſaith, that it was not dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or confirmed without
bloud; <hi>i.</hi> it began not to come in uſe among men, and to be of force,
before it was ratified by the bloudſhed of beaſts. For this bloud gave
beginning to that teſtament, in reſpect of the force of it. The Author
uſeth the very ſame word afterward Chap. 10.20. where our Engliſh
Tranſlation renders it conſecrated. By a new and living way which he hath
conſecrated unto us; whereof in it due place.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>For when Moſes had ſpoken every precept to
all the people</hi>] That <pb n="186" facs="tcp:61860:96"/>the firſt Teſtament was not
dedicated without bloud hee now proves, by a narration of the carriage of the
action, ſhewing the dedication or confirmation of that Teſtament both for
the manner and matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was confirmed; and his narration hereof is for
the moſt part ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Scripture. Exod. 24. Moſes did both ſpeake
and read all the precepts to the people. For firſt he ſpake them by word of
mouth, as the Lord had delivered them to him; and upon his rehearſing or
ſpeaking of them, the people gave their unanimous approbation and conſented
to doe them. Exod. 24.3. Then he wrote them in a book, and read them in the
audience of the people; and the people againe the ſecond time gave their
approbation. <hi>ibid.</hi> ver. 7. The word ſpoken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes both theſe
actions of reciting and reading; for all reading is ſpeaking alſo,
becauſe he that reads, ſpeaks out of a booke. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts by Moſes
confirmed, were all thoſe Lawes of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that did binde
univerſally, both perſons and times, which all perſons were bound to
obſerve perpetually; for ſuch were properly the precepts of Gods league
with the people, although happily they were not all aſſigned to the
preceding Chapters in Exod. but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in other places, and in the
following books of Moſes. For thoſe preceps which after the confirmation of
the league or teſtament, are deſcribed in the following Chapters of Exodus,
are not properly Lawes, but certaine Ordinances of God for the preſent,
concerning the framing and ordering of the Tabernacle, the furniture of it, and
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, whereby the worſhip of God was then to bee performed. And yet
there beſome, who think, that the paſſages recited, Exod. 24. concerning
the confirmation of the Covenant, are ſpoken only by way of hiſtoricall
anticipation. And this opinion is not without ſome ſhew of probability.
<hi>According to the Law</hi>] This is a limitation of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall word
every precept, to ſhew, that he ſpake not of all precepts in generall, but
of every precept in the Law delivered to Moſes, and written by Moſes in the
booke, and read by Moſes to the people. <hi>Hee tooke the bloud of calves and
of goats</hi>] It is not expreſſed in the ſtory of Moſes that he tooke
or ſhed the bloud of goats for that action. Yet it is very credible, that
there were goats among the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings then ſlaine
unto God. For that Moſes nameth only calves, it might therefore be, becauſe
they are the more worthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Unleſſe wee ſhould rather ſay,
that firſt the whole people was ſprinkled and expiated by Moſes, which
the Author chiefly reſpected, and might know it ſome other way; for the
bloud of goats was uſually ſhed to expiate the ſinnes of the whole
people. <hi>With water and ſcarlet wooll and hyſop</hi>] Neither doe wee
read this in the fore-cited place of Moſes; but the Author who undoubtedly
was very skilfull in the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh cuſtomes, doth perhaps therefore mention
water, becauſe hee knew that water was mingled with the bloud, which was
ſprinkled, as <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61860:96"/>was uſuall in other purifyings; for
bloud, unleſſe it bee mingled with water, doth quickly congeale, and being
congealed is unfit for ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But of hyſop and ſcarlet wooll tyed
to a cedar ſticke, was made a ſprinkler; whereof as of water mixt with
bloud, ſee Exod. 12.22. and Levit. 4.4,5,6. <hi>And ſprinkled both the
booke and all the people.</hi>] Of the booke being ſprinkled, we likewiſe
read not in Moſes. Yet this divine Author knew the certainty of this no
leſſe then of the reſt. But all the people is ſaid to be ſprinkled;
becauſe they among the people who ſtood neareſt were ſprinkled, and in
that reſpect repreſented the perſon of the whole people; ſo that
thereby all the people were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſprinkled.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Saying, this is the bloud of the
Teſtament</hi>] In the Hebrew for this, is Behold: but the ſenſe is the
ſame. Now the bloud of calves and goats, is called the bloud of the
Teſtament; becauſe by means of it, the Old Teſtament was confirmed and
eſtabliſhed. <hi>Which God hath enjoyned unto you</hi>] In the Hebrew it is
which God hath made with you. God had not yet made it preteritively; but did
then make it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentively: and therefore the preter tenſe is there
figuratively put for the preſent. But becauſe God himſelfe in his owne
perſon did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that Covenant with the people, but Moſes did it at
the command and in the name of God; therefore the Author expreſſing the
verity of the thing, for the word <hi>made,</hi> puts the word
<hi>enjoyned:</hi> as if Moſes had ſaid, This is the bloud of the
Teſtament, which God hath enjoyned me to make with you. Yet this injunction
or command did not reſt upon the perſon of Moſes only, but was extended
unto the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for as the confirmation of the teſtament was
enjoyned to Moſes, that he ſhould ſpeed it is Gods name: So the
obſervation of it, was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the people, that they ſhould keep it;
becauſe the Teſtament for the matter contained Laws and Precepts which God
enjoyned to the people; as if Moſes had further ſaid, This is the bloud of
the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God enjoyned unto me to confirme, and hath enjoyned unto
you to obſerve.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Moreover he ſprinkled with the bloud, both the
Tabernacle and all the veſſels of the Miniſtery</hi>] Hee ſhews, that
not only the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe was confirmed with bloud; but alſo
that under the Old Teſtament divers conſecrations and expiation were made
by bloud, eſpecially of ſinnes (as hee mentions it) ver. 22. This hee doth,
that from hence he might gather, that under the New Teſtament alſo the
ſhedding of bloud muſt fitly intervene to conſecrate and expiate the
conſcience; and a bloud ſo much more pretious, as he is more pretious, by
whom the conſcience is expiated. And the Author doth ſo joyne the
conſecration of the Tabernacle, and the veſſels of it made with bloud,
with the confirmation of the Teſtament it ſelfe, that he ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no
difference of time between them. And if the Tabernacle and <pb n="188" facs="tcp:61860:97"/>miniſteriall veſſels were conſecrated at the time, wherin the
Teſtament was confirmed, then without all doubt the hiſtory of confirming
the Teſtament, Exod. 24. is delivered by way of anticipation; ſeeing that
after that Confirmation mentioned there, precepts are delivered in the
following chapters, for the making of the Tabernacle and miniſteriall
veſſels; and for ordering of the publike worſhip and ſervice of God; as
alſo the making and conſecration of them is particularly deſcribed. But
from the words of the Author it cannot bee gathered, that both theſe were
done at the ſame time; ſeeing hee, to his former words of confirming the
Teſtament by bloud, doth ſimply ſubjoyne that Moſes did alſo
ſprinkle the Tabernacle, and the miniſterial veſſels with bloud; which
may as well be taken of another time, as of the ſame. Although Moſes
ſaith not openly, that the Tabernacle and miniſteriall veſſels, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were all finiſhed, were ſprinkled with bloud, but only anointed with
the holy oyle. Yet becauſe we read, that the Altar was not onely anointed
with oyle, but alſo ſprinkled and conſecrated with bloud; therefore hence
we may gather, that in the conſecration of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle it ſelfe, and of
the miniſteriall veſſells, ſprinkling of blood was joyned with their
anointing. For Joſephus delivers this in plain words in his Antiquitie, lib.
3. cap. 9. Where deſcribing the Ceremonie and forme of that Conſecration,
hee ſaith, <hi>Then hee ſprinkled the garments of Aaron and his ſonnes
with the bloud of the Sacrifices-purifying them with running water, and with
the ointment, &amp;c. He ſprinkled alſo the Tabernacle and his veſſels
with the ointment, and with the bloud of bullocks and rams, ſlaine every
other day after their kind.</hi>] From this verſe therefore it may appeare,
that anciently there were many things among the Jewes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning
external rites, of manifeſt truth, which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are not written
in the bookes of Moſes; and therefore wee need not marvell, that this Author
doth affirme ſome things, which we finde not delivered in the books of
Moſes; as we have noted already in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſe 4. and verſe
19.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>And almoſt all things by the law are purged
with bloud.</hi>] He am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plifies his former inſtances, drawing them from
particulars almoſt to an univerſall, to conclude his aſſertion by way
of Induction. Not only the Tabernacle and Miniſteriall veſſels, which
were the principall utenſils about the worſhip of God: but almoſt all
things elſe were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with bloud. He ſaith, almoſt all things;
becauſe ſome things were purged without bloud; for ſome were purged or
cleanſed onely by the waſhing of water, as hee that carried out the
Scape-goat muſt cleanſe himſelfe by waſhing his clothes and bathing his
fleſh in water. Levit. 16.26. And the Prieſt who became uncleane by the
touch of a perſon or thing unclean, muſt cleanſe himſelf by waſhing
his fleſh with water. Levit. 22.6. And ſome other things were firſt
purged by melting in the fire, and afterward repurged over with the water of
ſeparation, as <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61860:97"/>ſilver and gold, and all other mettals
that could abide to paſſe through the fire. Numb. 31.22,23. <hi>According
to the Law. i.</hi> According as the Law preſcribed, things ſhould be
purged. <hi>And without ſhedding of blood is no remiſsion</hi>] How ever
other things were purged, yet this is certaine that under the Law, ſinnes
were not remitted without ſhedding of bloud. Whence wee may rationally
gather, that the ſhedding of bloud, muſt alſo intervene for the purging
of our conſciences, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate thoſe ſinnes that pollute our
conſciences. That which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here affirmes, is moſt certaine
univerſally, and ſuffers no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſſe in caſe of extreme
poverty, when the perſons to bee purged were ſo poore, that for the purging
of their ſinne, they were not able to bring for their offering a paire of
Turtles, or a paire of yong Pigeons; whereof, ſee Levit. 5.12. Otherwiſe
the rule holds vniverſally, not onely for a ſinne of the whole people, but
alſo for the ſin of any ſingle perſon whatſoever, bloud muſt be
ſhed and a ſacrifice muſt be offered. See Levit. chap. 4. chap. 5. and
chap. 6.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>It was therefore neceſſary that the paterns
of things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the heavens ſhould
be purified with theſe.</hi>] Hitherto the Author hath taught, that bloud was
required for the purging both of the Tabernacle and of ſins. Now ſome man
might ſay; Although blood were required for this purifying, yet it was not
neceſſary that the blood of Chriſt ſhould be ſhed for it, but the
bloud of beaſts might have ſerved the turne, as it did under the Law. To
this tacite objection the Author anſweres in theſe words, and ſheweth,
that heavenly things were to be purged with farre better Sacrifices, then the
Sacrifices of beaſts. For the purging of earthly holy things, the
ſacrifices of beaſts did ſuffice: but for the purging of heavenly holy
things, which of all other are moſt excellent, there needed a moſt
excellent Sacrifice. And none could be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then Chriſt. And
beſides; for the purging of any Sanctuarie, there muſt needs be a
Sacrifice, or at leaſt ſome thing of the Sacrifice muſt be brought into
it. But neither beaſts themſelves, nor their bloud or bodies, neither
muſt, nor can be brought into that heavenly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. But Chriſt
himſelfe and his body made immortall, was brought in thither. Therefore for
heavenly holy things, the bloud of Chriſt muſt be ſhed, and not the bloud
of beaſts. Againe, the holy things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law were not onely purged when
they were firſt made and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, but alſo were yearly to be purged by
the annuall Sacrifice. For they were accounted pollutted by the yearely
ſinnes and uncleanneſſes of the people. Whereof ſee Levit. 16.15. How
the earthly holy things were paternes of thoſe things which are in heaven,
and for what cauſe, we have already ſhewed, chap. 8. ver. 5. The things in
the heavens are put for the holy heavenly things; from which the heaven it
ſelf, that inviſible heaven which is the moſt holy Sanctuary, muſt not
be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>But the heavenly things themſelves, with better
ſacrifices then theſe.</hi>] <pb n="190" facs="tcp:61860:98"/>The heavenly things, are
the heavenly holy things, as the verſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewes. But it may be
demanded, how thoſe heavenly holy things can be ſaid to be purged, ſeeing
they never were polluted? Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That this is ſaid of the heavenly
Sanctuary, onely by way of Compariſon, as a thing very uſuall. And the
nature of Compariſons is, to breed many abuſions. For if we reſpect the
ſcope of the Author, it is enough for us to underſtand, that the Sacrifice
to be offered in the heavenly Sanctuary, muſt be much more excellent then
thoſe, which of old were wont to be offered in the earthly Sanctuarie. For
this both the nature of the heavenly Sanctuary wholly requires, and alſo the
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the oblation ſutable to heaven. But if any man yet demand a more
neere reſemblance, it may be ſaid; That heavenly Sanctuary was indeed
purged by the Sacrifice and offering of Chriſt; Firſt, in as much as it was
ſo conſecrated thereby, that an acceſſe is made open for us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it;
and as I may ſay, it is dedicated for our uſe hereafter. As the old
Tabernacle and many things elſe, were not open and free for mens uſe,
before they were conſecrated; and they for their uncleanneſſe as it was
accounted: but this for our uncleanneſſe, which muſt bee purged away,
before a right and an uſe of that heavenly Sanctuary can be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us. So
that in this ſence, by a contrary way of ſpeech (and yet not unuſuall)
the Author ſaid that heaven muſt be purged, for our perfect purging, that
we may enjoy a right to heaven. Secondly, becauſe by the acceſſe of
ſinfull men, who by the doctrine of the Goſpel are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to take
poſſeſſion of the kingdome of heaven, it ſeemes to be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
which Chriſt himſelf hath expreſſed in other words, when he ſaid,
<hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by
force,</hi> Matth. 11.12. As the old Tabernacle was accounted polluted by the
ſins and uncleanneſſes of the people, who lived round about it.
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the high Prieſt of old did expiate that old Tabernacle as
pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſinnes of the people, with Sacrifices and Offerings, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled it, as it were, to its due holineſſe: So Chriſt as I may
ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored heaven to it due honour, when he offered himſelf there to
God, and thereby tooke order, that men guiltie of ſinnes, having firſt
depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſinnes by a lively faith and repentance, might not be
thought altogether unworthy of heaven. <hi>With better ſacrifices then
theſe</hi>] He puts the plural number for the ſingular, to comply with his
compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which included many Sacrifices; ſo that here alſo the
compariſon produced an abuſion. For by thoſe better Sacrifices, is meant
that ſingle ſacrifice of Chriſt offered. I ſay offered, becauſe by
uſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that onely is accounted a Sacrifice which is offered. For
Chriſt, after he was ſlaine, was himſelf offered, and therein is a
difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the old Sacrifices, eſpecially thoſe that were
expiatory, and the Sacrifice Chriſt; for when the old Sacrifice was ſlaine
the beaſt it ſelfe was not offered to God, but only the bloud of it, and
thoſe other parcels <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61860:98"/>that were burnt with fire upon the
Altar. But Chriſt himſelfe who was ſlaine, and not his bloud, was offered
to God; and hee not then, while yet he lay dead; but then when he was raiſed
to life, and ſuch a life as was eternall. Although (as we have often ſaid,)
in this ſacrifice of Chriſt offered, is alſo included the ſhedding of
his bloud and his bloudy death. For although Chriſt offered to God not his
bloud, but himſelfe; yet without the ſhedding of his bloud he neither could
nor might offer himſelfe. And by reaſon of what we have ſaid, therefore
it is, that the Author comparing Chriſt with the legall ſacrifices, doth
perpetually ſhun to ſay, that the bloud of Chriſt was offered; and yet
that he might comply with his compariſon, he perpetually inſinuates the
ſhedding of Chriſts bloud; which unleſſe it had preceded, there could
not have been ſo full and ſo fit a compariſon betweene Chriſt and the
old ſacrifices. From hence therefore it is manifeſt, that into thoſe holy
places of heaven for their purification and dedication, there muſt be brought
a moſt pretious ſacrifice; and therefore not the bloud of calves and goats,
nay not any bloud at all, but the very Sonne of God himſelfe, and hee alſo
ſtripped of all his mortall nature, then which there could not be imagined a
more pretious and more ſacred ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entered</hi>] Here hee gives
the reaſon why hee ſaid, that the heavenly holy places were purged with
better ſacrifices; namely, becauſe Chriſt our high Prieſt is entered
into no other holy places but thoſe of heaven. Whereupon it muſt follow,
that be muſt enter with a far better ſacrifice, and more worthy of thoſe
holy places, then the old high Prieſt entered into his earthly holy places.
<hi>Not into the holy places made with hands</hi>] He illuſtrates the matter
by a difference and an oppoſition between thoſe heavenly holy places and
the earthly; that thoſe were not made with hands; which difference we have
alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed before, ver. 11. <hi>Which are the figures of the true.</hi>
For figures, the Greeke text hath <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

the wax is figured from the ſeale, or mony from the ſtampe; which in this
place ſignifies the ſame that paternes did in the verſe before. Now the
holy places made with hands are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led antitypes or figures; not as oppoſed
efficiently to that which doth figure them; but as oppoſed objectively to the
thing whereof they are a figure, or which they are accounted to repreſent; as
the image or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription upon a peece of coine, is not properly the
image of the ſtampe which did imprint it; but of the Prince whoſe image it
is, and whom it repreſents: for the perſon of the Prince is that verity or
truth whereof the coine is but the image or figure. So that antitypes are here
put ſimply for types, which is an uſuall ſignification of the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Greeks. As in this ſenſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the earthly were but types, figures, and ſhadowes in reſpect of the
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; or becauſe thoſe qualities which ſhould have been in the
earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were found moſt truly and perfectly in the heavenly: And yet
thoſe earthly places were called holy, primely and properly, but the heavenly
metaphorically. After this manner, Chriſt is called <hi>the true light, the
true bread, and the true vine.</hi> Now the qualities of thoſe earthly places
are theſe; firſt, to be moſt ſacred or holy, and wholy ſeperate from
all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane uſes: and 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, to be an houſe or dwelling for God. Both
which qualities agreed to thoſe earthly holy places but umbratilouſly,
imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, and imperfectly: but to the heavenly holy places truly, really,
and perfectly. <hi>But into heaven it ſelf.</hi> Chriſt did never enter
into the earthly holy places, which were but the types &amp; figures of heaven;
but into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf where are the right &amp; true holy places. And he
is entred into that heaven which is beyond and above all the viſible orbes of
heaven, and into that place of that heaven which is the moſt holy, even where
the Throne of God is, at the right hand whereof he is ſeated. <hi>Now to
appeare in the preſence of God for us.</hi>] Hee gives the reaſon why
Chriſt entered into heaven; and he drawes his reaſon from the end of his
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. In expreſſing whereof he alludes to the ancient high Prieſt;
and the better to ſerve his alluſion, if we reſpect the property and
uſuall ſignification of his words, he faith leſſe of Chriſt, then the
thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and then the full end of his entrance came to. For the
ancient high Prieſt entring the moſt holy place, is ſaid to appeare
before God, becauſe he ſo procured the ſalvation of the people, that hee
himſelfe conferred it not, but obtained it from another, for he ſued to God
to conferre it. But the appearance of Chriſt our high Prieſt before God and
his offering of himſelfe, muſt bee ſo taken, that it exclude not his
ſitting at the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the heavens,
<hi>i.</hi> that he himſelfe, by virtue of a ſupreme power over all things
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by his Father, doth ſave his owne people; that he himſelfe doth
releaſe them from the guilt of all their ſins, and free them from all
puniſhments, and at laſt ſettle them in the reall poſſeſſion of
eternall bleſſedneſſe. In theſe words thus transferied from the old
high Prieſt unto Chriſt, the metaphor is ſo much the neater and fitter;
becauſe this way Chriſt is ſo ſaid to procure &amp; perfect our
ſalvation, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it may appeare what difference in that regard there
is between God and Chriſt: and becauſe Chriſt is thus farre like to one
appearing and interceding for others, in that he is very deſirous and
carefull of our ſalvation, yet hath not the power to ſave us from
himſelfe, but hath received it all from God. So that in this reſpect,
Chriſt may bee ſaid to be and is our Inteceſſour and Advocate; and God
of his mercy to <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61860:99"/>conferre ſalvation upon us. Beſides in
the Legall high Prieſt, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was a thing different and diſtinct
from his offering; though both were done at once and united in time; becauſe
the high Prieſt was one and the offering another; for the high Prieſt
appeared, but the bloud of the ſacrifice was offered. But in Chriſt our
high Prieſt, the offering and appearance as alſo the interceſſion were
really the ſame; if his appearance and interceſſion be taken, not for his
bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his Father, but for his comming joyned with his procuration of
our ſalvation, as here they muſt be taken; becauſe in Chriſt the
Prieſt and the offering were the ſame. For Chriſt by his appearance
offers himſelfe: and by offering himſelfe he appeares; and by offering and
appearing he intercedes. The particle <hi>now,</hi> is oppoſed to the times
paſt, eſpecially to thoſe of the Old Teſtament, wherein no ſuch high
Prieſt and Advocate appeared in the preſence of God for the people of God.
O the hard condition of thoſe times! and contrarily, Happy we, who have an
high Prieſt, <hi>and Advocate with the Father Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the
righteous; and he is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours onely,
but alſo for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1 John 2.1,2.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Not yet that he ſhould offer himſelfe
often</hi>] The particle <hi>nor yet</hi> ſhews, that the Author delivers two
negatives concerning Chriſt our high Prieſt; One is, that he is not entered
into the holy places made with hands, but into heaven it ſelfe; for this he
taught in the former verſe. The other when he entered into heaven, yet he did
not ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he ſhould iterate the oblation of himſelfe and offer
himſelfe often; contrary to the manner of the legall high Prieſts under the
Law, who were by Law conſtrained often to iterate their offering of bloud in
the holy place. This he teacheth in this verſe; which he therefore ſeemes
to do, that hence alſo it may appeare, how farre the ſacrifice of Chriſt
excelled the Legall ſacrifices; which muſt needs be often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, for no
other cauſe but by reaſon of their imperfection. From which reſpect he
gathers in the next Chapter, that they did not pleaſe God, and muſt at
length be abrogated, and were abrogated by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt. And
Chriſt ſhould be ſaid to offer himſelfe often, if once he ſhould
breake off his firſt appearance before God, and going out of his heavenly
Sanctuary, ſhould re enter in thither to iterate his offering. For his
oblation once begun, is not iterated and multiplyed by the duration or
continuation of it; for then, ſeeing Chriſt doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually appeare and
intercede for us, and therefore perpetually offer, the Author could not affirme
that Chriſt hath offered himſelfe onely once, and by one oblation of
himſelfe to perfect for ever thoſe that are ſanctified. There was not
required a double entrance into the earthly holy place to make a double
oblation, when there are two things that are offered, and a double ſlaughter
preceded, if thoſe things were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures. But when the thing to be
offered is but one, the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61860:100"/>of it cannot be
iterated, unleſſe the entrance, and the ſlaughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the entrance be
alſo iterated. For the ſlaughter muſt not be made in the holy place it
ſelfe, neither can it be in heaven; but without the holy place. Therefore the
Author ſaith, That Chriſt hath not ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the holy places of
heaven to performe his offering, that he ſhould often iterate it. <hi>As the
high Prieſt entereth into the holy place every yeare with bloud of
others</hi>] It was the manner of the Legall high Prieſt, to iterate their
oblation often. And in this oppoſition betweene Chriſt and the Legall high
Prieſt; that Chriſt ſhould not offer often, but the Legal high Prieſt
every yeare; that Chriſt entered heaven to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but the Legall
high Prieſt entered into the holy place with the bloud of others, every man
ſees that the offering of Chriſt, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Legall Prieſt
do anſwer one another. Whence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the expiatory offering
of Chriſt, as well as that of the Legall Prieſt, was performed by meanes of
his entrance into the holy place. <hi>Entereth.</hi> He ſeemes not to uſe
the preſent tenſe therefore, as if he had reſpect to a thing yet in being
and practiſe among the people of the Jews: but rather in an accuſtomed
manner of ſpeech, to draw the minde of the reader to a thing as it were
preſent; after which forme he ſpake alſo before, ver. 22. And in the
Goſpel of Marke we often meet with the like manner of ſpeech. That the
Legall Prieſt entered <hi>with bloud;</hi> hath the ſame ſence with the
ſaying before, that he entered <hi>by bloud,</hi> ver. 12. yet in the Greek
here it is <hi>in bloud;</hi> which for the ſence of it is truly tranſlated
<hi>with bloud.</hi> So John writes, that <hi>Chriſt came in water and bloud,
i.</hi> with water and bloud, though there our Engliſh Tranſlation render
it, by water and bloud, to ſuite the particle <hi>by</hi> going immediately
before, 1 John 5.6. But the Author ſhuns to ſay, That the Legall high
Prieſt was wont to enter the holy place <hi>with bloud;</hi> though this were
the proper ſaying; left the fitneſſe of the compariſon betweene
Chriſt and the Legall Prieſt ſhould in this reſpect be loſt; whereof
ſee what we have ſaid before, ver. 12. <hi>Of others.</hi> The bloud
wherewith the Legall Prieſt entered into the holy place was not his owne, but
the bloud of other creatures; for he entered with the bloud of Goats and
Calves; as it is before, ver. 12.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>For then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince
the foundation of the world</hi>] He proves why Chriſt muſt not offer
himſelfe often, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from an abſurdity that would follow upon it
if he did ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he muſt often have ſuffered; ſeeing the
oblation of a living creature cannot be made without ſlaughter and
ſuffering; and he muſt have ſuffered alſo from the foundation of the
world. But why from the foundation of the world? Of this one of theſe two
reaſons may ſeeme to be given. The firſt, that the oblation of Chriſt
ſhould therefore be iterated, that it might have ſo much the greater force
in expiating mens ſins. But if the oblation of Chriſt have it force from
number in the <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61860:100"/>iteration and frequentation of it, then it
muſt have begun from the beginning of the world; becauſe the ſooner it
began, the greater would be the number of his oblations, and thereupon a
greater force would reſult from them. The other reaſon is; that if Chriſt
ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten iterate his oblation, he muſt do it in this regard after the
likeneſſe of the Legall high Prieſt, whereby to ſome it may ſeeme
reaſon, that Chriſt alſo ſhould often offer himſelfe. But if we
muſt reſpect a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Legall Prieſt, and from thence
reckon the nature and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſts oblations, then Chriſt muſt have
made the beginning of his oblations from the beginning of the world. For by
this meanes there muſt ariſe a kinde of analogie and juſt proportion
betweene the number of oblations of Chriſt and the Legall Prieſt. For
ſeeing the people were under the Law for the ſpace of about fifteene
hundred yeares, it is an eaſie matter to reckon how often the Legall
Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; for, ſeeing they offered every yeare, therefore it muſt
needs follow, that they offered about fifteene hundred times. That therefore
the offerings of Chriſt might in ſome juſt number be anſwerable to ſo
great a multitude of Legall ſacrifices, muſt not Chriſt begin his
offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings from the beginning of the world? For, though he ſhould ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
offer as the Legall Prieſt did according as the analogy required, yet he
muſt offer often, and ſo often, as there might be a juſt proportion
betweene the iteration and frequentation of both their offerings. But this
proportion would not be, if Chriſt ſhould offer onely ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
times, though they were a hundred. For he muſt iterate his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by
ſpaces or diſtances of time anſwering to a leſſe number of
offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, which diſtances muſt not be ſmall, but great, and thoſe
ſet and equall as of old under the Law, as imagine once in every ſeverall
age of man. But if this were done, muſt he not have begun from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, and not now at laſt when the world declines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an end?
For, ſeeing this is the laſt age of the world, wherein Chriſt appeared,
it is not likely that it ſhall laſt longer then the former? But for ſo
many offerings to be performed at ſpaces of time anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as we have
ſaid, it would ſcarce and nothing neere have beene enough to have begun at
the beginning of the world. The Author therefore doth beat downe the argument
drawne from the multitude of the Legall offerings to conclude the frequency of
Chriſt his offerings; and ſhewes, that if this reſemblance or
likeneſſe were to bee attended, then of neceſſity it muſt follow,
that Chriſt muſt not only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuffer, which of it ſelfe is abſurd
and inconvenient (for men have but one death before Judgement and cannot die
often, as is declared in the following verſe) but alſo muſt have begun
his ſufferings and offerings from the beginning of the world. The words
ſince the foundation of the world, are not neceſſarily to bee taken from
the firſt Creation of the world: but are onely oppoſed to 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61860:101"/>the conſummation or end of the world, as appeares by
the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly following. But this end of the world here, doth not
ſignifie the extreme and finall terme of the world, nor yet ſome ſmall
ſpace of time, wherein the world muſt have an end, but only the old age, or
laſt age of the world, as oppoſed to her infancy and firſt age. Wherefore
alſo the foundation of the world in this place, muſt be ſo extended as to
ſignifie the infancy or firſt age of the world. So Chriſt ſaith, Luke
11.50. That <hi>the bloud of all the Prophets which was ſhed from the
founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, ſhould be required of this generation.</hi>]
Although the firſt bloud that was ſhed of the Prophets was done for the
ſpace of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeers after the Creation of the world. <hi>But now once in the
end of the world hath he appeared.</hi> Here the Authour removes the former
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that was inconſequent and abſurd, by affronting it with the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and by inferring the contrary from the remotion of it. Chriſt then
did not begin his ſufferings and offerings from the beginning of the world;
but now in the end of the world, and therefore in the end of it, hath he
appeared; and that once onely, by one Sacrifice of himſelf. The word
<hi>appeared</hi> in this place, may be taken either to ſignifie the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt before God in his heavenly Sanctuary, whereof the
Author ſpake before, verſe 24. or to note his comming into this world to
performe his office. But there are chiefly two things that ſeeme to
withſtand the former ſence. Firſt; becauſe theſe words may be better
oppoſed to the words immediatly preceding, then to thoſe ſaid in the
former verſe; which latter notwithſtanding the former ſence of the word
<hi>appeaſed</hi> requires. For to the offering often to be made, the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in heaven once made ſhould be oppoſed. But that it ſhould be
oppoſed to the words immediatly preceding, it ſeemes both by the words
<hi>in the end of the world,</hi> manifeſtly oppoſed to thoſe <hi>ſince
the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> which goe immediatly before; and alſo it
ſeemes ſo by the manner of arguing, which the Author here uſeth. For as
the thing it ſelfe declares, he uſeth an Hypotheticall ſyllogiſme,
whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is in the words immediatly preceding, and the
aſſumption in theſe words; for he argues from a remotion of the
conſequent, which is this, Chriſt muſt often ſuffer from the foundation
of the world, to the remotion of the antecedent, that Chriſt muſt often
offer himſelf. And he removes that conſequent by the poſition of the
contrary, as we ſaid, namely, that Chriſt hath appeared once only in the
end of the world, to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelfe. Wherefore
hee ſeemes to ſpeak of that appearance, which preceded both his ſuffering
and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; namely, of that appearance whereby Chriſt firſt manifeſted
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto the world, for the performance of his office upon earth,
whereby he began to be known to the world; &amp; that appearance once made, is
rightly oppoſed to the ſuffering often to be made; for as often as Chriſt
muſt ſuffer; ſo often hee muſt come into the world and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61860:101"/>The other thing that ſeemes to withſtand the former
opinion, is, that the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here
uſed by the Author, is no where read for the appearance either of the legall
Prieſt or of Chriſt before God, to procure expiation; but when it is
abſolutely ſpoken of any one, as here it is, it noteth nothing elſe but
his manifeſtation among men. But he ſaith that Chriſt hath appeared in
the end of the world, leaſt any man ſhould think that there were yet time
enough for Chriſt to iterate his offerings, and by a juſt proportion equall
the number of the legall offerings: although hee began not to ſuffer and
offer himſelfe from the foundation of the world. For becauſe hee ſuffered
and offered himſelfe in the end of the world; hence it appeares, that there
is not time enough yet to come to ſerve for the multitude of his ſufferings
and offerings. But the time wherein Chriſt came, is therefore called the end
of the world, becauſe it is the laſt age of the world, and as it were the
old age of it, and becauſe the other comming of Chriſt, which is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the conſummation and end of the world, is alwayes ſuppoſed to be at
hand; which could in no wiſe be, if the offering of Chriſt were to be
iterated anſwerably to the juſt number and proportion of the old Legall
offerings. But the holy Ghoſt would have us perpetually wait for the
expectation of Chriſts comming. For that his comming and together with it,
the end of the world is yet deferred, and that ſo many ages have paſſed
ſince his firſt comming into the world, &amp; ſeating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heavenly
throne; this in a manner is accidentall, by reaſon of the long ſuffering of
God, <hi>who is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould
come to repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>To put away ſin by the ſacrifice
of himſelfe</hi>] He ſhews the finall cauſe of the comming and appearance
of Chriſt; which is for the putting away of ſin; which is done when all the
force and power of ſin is deſtroyed. Which deſtruction of ſin is
effected two wayes; the one is, when ſin hath no power to condemne men; the
other, when it hath no power to ſubdue men; by enthralling them under the
yoke of it. That both theſe effects might be produced, Chriſt hath
appeared; both that he might deliver men from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne; and
alſo from the dominion of it, even freeing them from ſin it ſelfe. Now
the meanes whereby Chriſt hath put away ſinne, in deſtroying the power of
it, is <hi>by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.</hi> For this act may be joyned as
well with the word <hi>ſuffered,</hi> as with <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared;</hi> as other
Interpreters alſo have obſerved. 
<note place="margin">How the ſacrifice of Chriſt purgeth away
our ſins.</note> For Chriſt by the ſacrifice of himſelfe hath
caſhired and put away ſinne, by taking from it all it power to condemne and
to reigne; which though we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, yet are we willing to repeat
it againe, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of ſuch moment, that if it may be, we
might drive and faſten it throughly into mens mindes. For as concerning the
guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſinnes, can there bee any ſinnes (ſo that we
doe our duty) which a ſacrifice ſo acceptable to God, offered in the

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:61860:103"/>heaven,
and by ſo great an high Prieſt, cannot expiate? Can there be any danger,
that he will deale negligently in our cauſe, who offered up himſelfe as a
ſacrifice for our ſinnes? and who having himſelfe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all thoſe
miſeries and preſſures that can poſſibly befall us, hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
a minde ſo prone to pity us? Hath not yet the wiſhed effect been
anſwerable to ſo holy a ſacrifice, and to ſo carefull a proviſion of
our high Prieſt? Is not the power of our ſalvation in the power of our high
Prieſt, and in his hand to releaſe whom he will of ſinne, and to beſtow
eternall life and whatſoever good thing beſides upon whom he will? Doth he
not negotiate the matter with his moſt deare Father, who himſelfe burnes
with a deſire of our ſalvation, who himſelfe hath made a ſacred
Covenant for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, who himſelfe ordained the
holy Sacrifice for our ſinnes, who himſelfe would have it offered unto him,
and cauſed it to be offered, who himſelfe ordained our high Prieſt with
an oath, and committed unto him the whole care of our ſalvation? Now
concerning the dominion of ſinne, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the yoke of it;
can it poſſibly be, that when we perceive ſo great and ſo certaine
cauſes and proofes of our eternall ſalvation, and of plenary remiſſion
of our ſinnes, that we ſhould not with all our ſouls embrace the faith of
Chriſt, and devote our ſelves wholly to him? when by this means, through
the grace and mercy of our God wee are effectually purged and juſtified from
the guilt of all our ſins, ſhall we not contend with our whole force to
abandon ſin for ever after, &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addict our ſelves to holines?
ſhall we not labour to the utmoſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this great grace of God
entire and whole to our laſt gaſpe, that at length we may enjoy the full
fruit of it, in our deliverance from death, and inheritance of eternall life?
And ſhall it not mightily incourage us to ſhake off the yoke of ſin, in
that our heavenly high Prieſt will perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſupport us with his Spirit,
&amp; ſupply us with power enough to live holily, if we will live ſo, and
will ſtrive to do it. This therefore is the manner after which Chriſt by
the Sacrifice of himſelf hath put away ſin, that neither it might hurt us,
nor reign in us. The Sacrifice of Chriſt is Chriſt himſelf ſacrificed;
being firſt ſlain &amp; then raiſed to immortall life, that he might
enter his heavenly Tabernacle, and therein offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and appear for us
for ever. The word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

which ſignifies to ſlay; yet it uſeth not to be taken in Scripture
abſtractedly for the ſlaughter, but concretly for the creature
ſlaughtered, or rather for that part of it which is offered to God. But if
any man keeping the ſame ſenſe will joyn theſe words by the ſacrifice
of himſelf, with the verb appeared, then the particle <hi>by</hi> muſt be
taken for <hi>with;</hi> and in that ſenſe as we have noted before, that
John ſaith, Chriſt came by <hi>water and bloud, i.</hi> with water and
bloud; not that at his firſt comming into the world, hee ſhed his bloud,
but becauſe he therefore came that he might ſhed his bloud, though 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61860:103"/>not forthwith. So Chriſt may be ſaid to appeare with
the ſacrifice of himſelfe; not that as ſoon as he appeared he was made a
ſacrifice, but that he ſo appeared, that in his due time, he might be made
a ſacrifice. But we beſt approve of that ſenſe, which joynes theſe
words <hi>by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelfe,</hi> with the words immediatly
preceding, <hi>to put away ſinne.</hi> For the finall end of the appearance
or comming of Chriſt, was to put away ſin; and the meanes whereby he
aboliſhed it was, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelfe. Seeing therefore
Chriſt came in the end of the world, that he might aboliſh ſinne by the
ſacrifice of himſelfe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hence it appears, that he muſt not
often iterate his ſacrifice after the manner of the legall high Prieſt; for
otherwiſe he muſt have begunne this action more early, and not have
deferred it to the laſt age of the world.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>And as it is appointed unto men, once to
dye</hi>] He brings a new argument to confirm and illuſtrate the ſingle or
only ſacrifice of Chriſt, drawne from a ſimilitude or compariſon of the
death of Chriſt, with the common law and condition of men, who dye but once,
and not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Greeke word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
is well rendred by ſome learned men, befalleth; as one death befalleth all
men. For it ſeems not that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor intended, that this word by it ſelfe
ſhould ſignifie ſome divine decree; although he thereby excludes it not;
for this word may have ſuch a latitude of ſenſe as to ſignifie, both
that which is appointed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men by the law of nature, and that which by Gods
decree is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to ſome particular man. In the firſt particle of
theſe words, which ſpeake of death, he ſeems to reſpect rather what is
done by the force and courſe of nature, then what follows by force of Gods
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. For that death muſt bee here underſtood that is common to all men,
even to the godly, and is temporall; becauſe it is that death after which
judgement follows which kinde of death is due unto us rather by our naturall
condition, then deſtinated to us by force of any divine decree. And
beſides, we muſt underſtand, that the Author ſpeaks not here ſo much
of the neceſſity of death, that men are ſimply appointed to dye (for that
gives no helpe to his argument) as of the ſingularity of death, in that men
dye but once and not twice, or more often, to the end he might from thence
conclude, that Chriſt alſo muſt dye but once onely; and therefore muſt
offer himſelfe but once onely. But the ſingularity of mens death, that they
dye but once, proceeds meerly from nature, and depends not from any peculiar
decree of God: but for a man to dye a ſecond time or more often, cannot be,
but from a peculiar decree of God. And therefore by theſe words nothing
elſe is ſignified, then that one onely death is allotted unto men, or that
they dye but once only. <hi>But after this the judgement.</hi>] This indeed
depends from Gods decree; therefore the word appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as we ſaid) muſt
be taken in his latitude and generally, to ſignifie <pb n="200" facs="tcp:61860:104"/>only a thing whoſe event is certaine; whether it flow from nature
it ſelfe, as once to dye; or whether it follow upon Gods decree, as the
future judgement. But that judgement doth not ſo much conſiſt in
pronouncing the ſentence upon all men both quicke and dead, as in executing
the ſentence already adjudged. For this is no humane judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a
divine; for the diſpatch whereof, there needs no witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, no prooffes,
no accuſers or advocates, no tedious diſquiſition of the truth. For to
Chriſt who is the ſupreme Judge, all things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready evident, and he
hath already determined, who is to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and who to be juſtified,
before he doth actually condemne or juſtifie any one; <hi>i.</hi> either
deſtroyes or ſaves any one. As therefore one death befalles men, and after
that, will come the judgement, wherein all ſhall appeare againe to be judged;
<hi>i.</hi> either to be rewarded or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to every mans deeds,
2 Cor. 5.19. So alſo Chriſt once only ſuffered death, that he might once
only performe his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but he ſhall appeare againe in judgement, and
ſhall ſhew himſelf to be ſeen of them that expect him to
ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>So Chriſt was once offered</hi>] His offering
anſwers to his death; not that his offering conſiſteth in his death, for
that is untrue (as wee have ſhewed before:) but becauſe the offering of a
creature that hath life cannot bee performed without death: And therefore
Chriſt was offered but once, becauſe he muſt dye but once, and but one
ſingle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering could follow one ſingle death. <hi>To beare the ſinnes
of many</hi>] The end whereto his offering was a meane, was to beare the
ſinnes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to
beare; though it properly ſignifie to lift or carry ſomething from a lower
place to an higher, or at leaſt from one place to another: yet in this place,
it ſimply ſignifies to take away. For things lifted up are firſt taken
away from the place where they were before; and things taken or carried away
from a man, muſt firſt be raiſed and lifted up. But in that ſinnes are
ſaid to be taken away, is a metaphor. But that the word <hi>to beare</hi>
here doth ſimply ſignifie to take away or put away, as we have ſaid, wee
can make it plaine by divers examples extant in the Septuagint; ſee Jof.
24.32. and 2 Sam. 21.13. and Ezra 1.11. and Pſal. 102.24. where the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hath this ſenſe. But in this
place this ſenſe is neceſſary, ſeeing this is the end for which
Chriſt was once offered: but the offering of Chriſt as we have ſhewed,
was performed in heaven. Whence it follows, that this word no way ſignifies,
that Chriſt tooke upon himſelf the puniſhment of our ſinnes; becauſe
that cannot be done in heaven, ſeeing heaven is no place for puniſhment.
Beſides, it is moſt reaſonable, that theſe words ſhould have the
ſame ſenſe with the former, that Chriſt appeared to put away ſinne;
ſeeing theſe are correſpondent one to another, and the end of Chriſts
offering is ſhewed in both. But he faith to beare the ſinnes of
<hi>many.</hi> Not ſimply of all, partly becauſe this benefit for the 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61860:104"/>effect and iſſue of it, pertaines not by Gods
purpoſe promiſcuouſly to all, but onely to thoſe that beleeve in
Chriſt and obey him, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all will not beleeve in Chriſt and
obey him; whence it comes to paſſe, that all are not in effect eaſed from
the burden of ſinne, which notwithſtanding in reſpect of Gods purpoſe
is but in event; becauſe all to whom ſoever God offers his grace, and
calls, both may and ought to beleeve and obey. The ſame alſo we ſay for
the taking away of ſinnes, whoſe end is, that men ſhould be no longer
addicted to their ſinnes; for if we reſpect the event or effect it ſelfe,
Chriſt by his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath put away the ſins of many onely, not of all,
and thereby hath effected that many and not all doe live holily. For in
reſpect of the force and efficacy of Chriſts offering, Chriſt is to be
ſuppoſed to have taken away the ſinnes themſelves, and the puniſhment
of ſinnes from all men. <hi>He ſhall appeare the ſecond time without
ſinne</hi>] The ſecond time is in Judgement, and the words <hi>without
ſinne</hi> may be taken two wayes. Firſt, as they may ſignifie without an
offering or ſacrifice for ſin, which according to a common uſe of
Scripture is called <hi>ſinne;</hi> in which ſence this appearance without
ſin, may fitly be oppoſed to his former appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with ſinne, that is,
with an offering for ſin, ver. 26. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this oppoſition, it
will not ſeeme amiſſe, to joyne the words <hi>by the ſacrifice of
himſelfe,</hi> with the word <hi>appeared,</hi> unleſſe we had rather
make this latter part of the verſe oppoſite to the former part; that ſo
the going of Chriſt from us, and his returne unto us may be oppoſed to his
offering, which was performed by his bloudy death, and after it by his entrance
into heaven; for thereby Chriſt was taken from the eyes of men and ceaſed
to be ſeene: but by his returne he will againe ſhew himſelfe to bee
ſeene, and then the words <hi>without ſinne,</hi> are oppoſed to thoſe
<hi>to beare</hi> (or take away) <hi>the ſinnes of many;</hi> and the words
<hi>the ſecond time</hi> ſhall be oppoſed to the particle <hi>once;</hi>
and yet <hi>the ſecond time</hi> may in this place be all one with
<hi>afterward;</hi> that it may anſwer the words of the former verſe
<hi>after this</hi> the judgement; ſo in the Epiſtle of Jude, ver. 5. the
words <hi>once</hi> and <hi>afterward</hi> are oppoſed. Secondly; the words
<hi>without ſinne</hi> may be ſo taken, as thereby to ſhew, that when
Chriſt ſhall appeare the ſecond time, there ſhall bee no more guilt of
ſinne in the people of God, as there was when firſt he appeared, which
therefore he muſt take away by his ſacrifice. For undoubtedly the Author
here alludes to the returne of the Legall high Prieſt out of the holy place,
who went into the holy place to take away the guilt of ſinnes, and returned
from thence without ſinne; for he had taken away the guilt of ſinne by his
offering. So Chriſt ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into heaven that there offering himſelfe to
God, and appearing in his preſence, he might purge his people from the guilt
of their ſinnes: but having aboliſhed the guilt of ſins, he ſhall
returne out from heaven, and appeare unto his people, to give them the effect
of that guilt taken <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61860:105"/>away, not in words onely, as the
Legall high Prieſt gave the people his benediction and prayed for them; but
in very deed; for he ſhall vindicate them from death, and eſtate them in
eternall life. <hi>Vnto them that looke for him unto ſalvation</hi>] The
words <hi>unto ſalvation</hi> may agree either with <hi>he ſhall
appeare,</hi> or with the words <hi>to them that looke for him</hi>] And the
Author ſeemes to have placed them ſo on purpoſe, that they might be
referred to both. For both Chriſt ſhall appeare to give his people
ſalvation; and the people of Chriſt ſhall looke for his comming out of
heaven to receive ſalvation from him. For as Chriſt is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
compared with the Legall high Prieſt entered into the boly place: ſo his
people are reſembled to the people of Iſrael expecting without the
Tabernacle. For of old the people looked for the Legall Prieſt, after their
manner to ſalvation, namely, that by him they might obtaine remiſſion of
their ſinnes which were then expiated, and might heare his benediction to
them in the Name of God: So the people of Chriſt, being without the heavenly
Tabernacle upon earth, do looke for Chriſt their high Prieſt unto
ſalvation, that he comming forth out of his heavenly Sanctuary, they may by
him obtaine eternall ſalvation. The Author in theſe words doth elegantly
deſcribe a Chriſtian; for this expectation doth comprehend faith in
Chriſt; for unleſſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, they will never expect his
returne from heaven as their heavenly high Prieſt; And this expectation doth
either beget holineſſe of life, or is begotten of it; for theſe affoord
each other their helpe. The expectation of ſalvation upon condition of
obedience doth beget piety; and piety brought forth doth reciprocally bring
forth a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like to her mother, that is, a moſt certaine and ardent
expectation of ſalvation. Hither belong the words of Paul to the
Theſſalonians, 1 Theſ. 1.9,10. where he deſcribes all Chriſtian
people and their whole duty, ſaying, <hi>Ye have turned to God from Idols, to
ſerve the living and true God; and to waite for his Son from heaven, whom he
raiſed from the dead, even Ieſus who delivered us from the wrath to
come.</hi> After a like manner he deſignes all beleevers in Chriſt, by the
name of them that love his appearing, 2 Tim. 4.8.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the Law having a ſhadow</hi>] He had ſaid
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Legall high Prieſt entered yearly into the holy place, not
with his owne bloud, but with the bloud of others: contrary to what Chriſt
did, who offered himſelfe once onely. Now here he gives the reaſon thereof;
becauſe the Law by a continuall offering of the ſame ſacrifices yearly;
can never make the commers thereunto perfect; for therefore it is that thoſe
offerings are iterated yeare by yeare. This reaſon he doth by the way confirm
by another reaſon; becauſe the law hath only a ſhadow of future
bleſſings, and not the very image of them. Therefore the cauſal particle
<hi>for,</hi> hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to what was ſaid immediatly before, but
muſt in this place be referred to his principall doctrine, though more
remote: which was; That the legall high Prieſt offered year by year, but
Chriſt once only. <hi>A ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very
image of the things.</hi>] Thoſe good things to come, may be underſtood
more largely or ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Firſt largely; to comprehend both eternall
happineſſe it ſelfe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed or bequeathed us in the new Teſtament,
&amp; alſo all the helps and meanes for the acquiring of it, affoorded us
under the ſame Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pourtrayed in the legall ſhadowes; ſuch
as are Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe our high Prieſt, his Bloud, his Offering, his
Sanctuarie, and ſuch like; for theſe were future and to come in reſpect
of the Law, Or they may be taken ſtrictly, onely for the happineſſe
promiſed us. Neither of theſe ſences are diſagreeing to the text; yet
the latter is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by reaſon of thoſe words in the former
chapter, verſe 11. wherein Chriſt is ſaid to be a high Prieſt of good
things to come; and ſo the Prieſt and his Prieſthood are manifeſtly
diſtinguiſhed; and if ye marke it well, ſo is his Sanctuarie and his
Sacrifice. But ſeeing there is no open mention of theſe good things to
come, but only in that text, and this which we have now in hand, &amp; that in
both the ſame thing is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; it is moſt agreeable to reaſon, that the
good things to come in this place ſhould be taken ſtrictly, for the
happineſſe onely promiſed us in the new teſtament, which comprehends
our perpetual deliverance from all puniſhments of all our ſins, &amp; our
eternal inheritance of eternall life. For by the admitting of this ſenſe
wee ſhall the more eaſily interpret the words following, concerning the
very <hi>image of the things.</hi> For this condition ſeemes plainely taken
from the Law, and attributed to the <pb n="205" facs="tcp:61860:106"/>Goſpel. Of thoſe
things which are not ſo much the parts of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe as the means
and adjuncts of it, the Goſpel doth not exhibit unto us the image, but the
ſubſtances themſelves: but of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it propoſeth to us
in this life rather the image then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; although our deliverance
from the puniſhments of our ſinnes doe in ſome meaſure begin in this
life. But it exhibits unto us the very image of them, in as much as it
deſcribes and promiſeth them moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to us; ſo that are may ſeem
in a manner to ſee them before our eyes. But the Law had only a ſhadow of
thoſe good things, from whence we could but conjecture very darkly and
imperfectly, what and what manner of things they were. To that ſhadow
contained in the Law were proportionably anſwering both the ſacrifices, by
meanes whereof thoſe good things were attained, and alſo the high Prieſt,
the Sanctuary, and ſuch like. But now ſeeing a clear and perfect image of
thoſe celeſtiall goods is propoſed unto us, and promiſed us in plaine
and open tearmes, therefore there are required other ſacrifices, which have
an apparent and manifeſt vertue and efficacie to procure thoſe goods unto
us, which can beget in our ſoules a moſt aſſured hope of them, and can
draw us to a courſe of life ſutable to them. <hi>Can never by thoſe
ſacrifices which they offered yeare by yeare continually</hi>] The words
<hi>yeare by yeare,</hi> doe not ſeem to cohere with offered; for then there
is a great and hard tranſpoſition of the words: but agree rather with
<hi>thoſe ſacrifices,</hi> for ſo the ſenſe is facile and uſuall;
as if hee had ſaid, the ſame ſacrifices recurring yeare by yeare: whereby
he would intimate, that under the Law the ſame ſacrifices were offered, yet
not every day, and moneth, but every yeare: and every yeare ſacrifices were
offered, yet not diverſe, but the ſame; the ſame kinde yeare by yeare.
The ſpace of time whereby thoſe ſacrifices were diſtant one from
another was a yeare; and when the yeare came about, the ſacrifice was of the
ſame kinde. <hi>Which they offered</hi>] The perſons who did make the
offering were the high Prieſts, to whom the Law enjoyned it. But here the
words are put in a paſſive ſenſe to ſignifie the ſacrifices which
were offered. For ordinary it is, that an active forme of ſpeech doth carry a
paſſive ſenſe. So Luke 12.20. The words are active, <hi>This night
ſhall they require thy ſoule:</hi> But the ſenſe is paſſive; this
night thy ſoule ſhall be required. <hi>Continually</hi>] In this there is
more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied then in the words yeare by yeare: for it intimates, that the
courſe of yeares wherein yeare by yeare the ſame ſacrifices were
iterated, was not interrupted nor intermitted, but conſtantly continued; and
the continuance of this cuſtome was not ſhort for the ſpace of ſome few
yeares ſucceſſively; but a long continuance for many ages. <hi>Can never
make the commers thereunto perfect.</hi> Although the ſame ſacrifices were
yeare by yeare iterated without intermiſſion for a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: yet
the Law by means of thoſe ſacrifices could never perfect the 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61860:107"/>Commers thereto. The Commers were all ſuch amongſt
Gods people as came to worſhip God and ſerve him by means of thoſe
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: and therefore in the verſe following, the ſame perſons in
the ſame reſpect are called the worſhippers. For in the peoples
acceſſe or comming to the Tabernacle, is alſo included that divine
worſhip and ſervice which there they performed. Seeing their Acceſſe
and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither was but for worſhip and ſervice; and ſeeing again,
that worſhip and ſervice might bee done no where elſe but by comming
there; for the Law forbad the people to offer ſacrifice in any other place
but the Sanctuary. To <hi>perfect</hi> ſignifies to expiate or purge from
ſinne, and to expiate ſo fully and finally, that the party once expiate
ſhall want nothing elſe; ſhall need no other oblation of any other
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, nor no iteration of the ſame; and conſequently ſhall feele
no further conſcience of his ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For then would they not have ceaſed to be
offered</hi>] This ſentence ſhould not be rendred negatively, <hi>then they
would not have ceaſed</hi>] for this negation is quite contrary to the
ſenſe and reaſoning of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But affirmatively thus, for then
would <hi>they have ceaſed to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</hi> For becauſe the ſame
ſacrifices were yeare by yeare offered continually; therefore from thence he
proves, that they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the worſhippers or commers to the
ſacrifices; and this their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection he further confirmes <hi>ab
abſurdo;</hi> for if the ſame ſacrifices could have perfected the commers
thereto, they would have ceaſed from being iterated and offered againe yeare
by yeare continually. For what need the ſame ſacrifices be iterated yeare
by yeare, if they could perfect the commers to them, by expiating their
ſinnes fully and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? for if the ſacrifices had done this, then they
muſt have finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and ceaſed. But ſeeing they could not do
this, therefore they ceaſed not, but were offered &amp; iterated year by year
continually. <hi>Becauſe that the worſhippers once purged ſhould have no
more conſcience of ſins</hi>] Here he gives a reaſon of the former
affirmation, why the ſame ſacrifices ſhould have ceaſed to be offered;
namely, becauſe the worſhippers once purged and expiated perfectly ſhould
have no more conſcience of ſins. To have conſcience of ſinnes
ſignifies two things; whereof the one is conſequent to the other, as to
know himſelfe guilty of ſinne, and to acknowledge himſelfe guilty of
puniſhment. The maine doctrine which the Author teacheth is this: That
thoſe ſacrifices had not force to effect, that men ſhould know
themſelves not guilty of ſinne; which is then done when they abſtain from
ſinne; and then, that men ſhould not acknowledge themſelves guilty of
puniſhment, which is then done when they are not afraid of it: Therefore they
were iterated yeare by yeare continually for a long ſucceſſion of many
ages, that year by year they might heale the ſore of the conſcience, which
broke out againe yeare by yeare. For where health is fully recovered and
ſetled, the <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61860:107"/>medicine is not iterated: but if there be
relapſes and the diſeaſe have recourſes, the uſe of the medicin
muſt be often applied: either therefore that Sacrifice being once offered
muſt expiate the future ſins of all the future years and ages to come,
although it withdrew not men from the acts of ſinne; or if this be abſurd,
then, ſeeing it could not withdraw men from the acts of ſinne, there was
good reaſon, it ſhould be ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated yearly, to heale the conſcience
yearly wounded with ſinnes. But it had been very abſurd that the ſins of
ſo many men and ages ſhould be purged by the bloud of one goat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>But in thoſe ſacrifices is a remembrance againe
made of ſinnes every yeare</hi>] Here he teacheth the contrary to the laſt
conſequence; namely, that after thoſe Sacrifices the conſciences of the
people were againe guilty of ſinnes: And this he proves thus, becauſe at
thoſe Sacrifices yeare by yeare, the high Prieſt did yeare by yeare,
rememorate and confeſſe the ſinnes of the people. For he muſt lay both
his hands upon the head of the Scape-goat, and confeſſe over him all the
iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions in
all their ſins, &amp;c. Levit. 16.21. For to this place the Author here hath
reference. <hi>In thoſe ſacrifices; i.</hi> then at that ſolemne
Faſt-day, when thoſe Sacrifices were offered; the ſinnes of the people
were alſo remembred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. For though the yeare before they were
all laid upon the head of the Scape-goat and baniſhed into the
wilderneſſe together with the goat: yet the next yeare and
ſucceſſively yeare by yeare another goat muſt be baniſhed, becauſe
the people had more ſins to be baniſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For it is impoſsible that the bloud of bulls, and
of goats ſhould take a way ſinnes</hi>] Here hee gives a reaſon of his
principall aſſertion, That thoſe Sacrifices could never perfect the
commers thereto, by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the very nature of thoſe
Sacrifices; becauſe they were but the bloud of bulls and goats, which hath no
poſſiblity to take away ſinnes; <hi>i.</hi> it cannot effect, that men
ſhould afterward abſtaine from ſinne, and ſo have no further
conſcience of ſinnes, and conſequently feare no puniſhment of them. For
what force can the bloud of beaſts have to produce this effect? But the bloud
of Chriſt hath this effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie and
force; and all men may eaſily acknowledge it if they will: of which point, we
have formerly treated in ſeverall places. Yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith not, that
the bloud of thoſe beaſts had no force at all, in no meaſure, and for no
time to take away the guilt of thoſe ſinnes, for which by the Law of God it
was to be offered: ſeeing this is evidently falſe, for if it expiated not
ſinne at all in no meaſure; to what purpoſe was it offered year by year?
Why doth the Author himſelfe affirme that the worſhippers for whom it was
offered, were once purged by it? Certainly then, they did purge ſome ſinnes
for ſome time; namely, ſins of error for a year: Therefore the minde of the
Author is (as we have explicated it before) that the bloud of bulls and goats
hath not any <pb n="208" facs="tcp:61860:108"/>force, and impoſſible it is, it ſhould
have any, to withdraw men from their ſins, and to effect, that afterward they
ſhould not ſinne, and ſo to free them from feare and guilt of all future
puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Wherefore when he commeth into the world</hi>] From
the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and infirmity which he hath ſhewed to be in the Legall
ſacrifices, the Author gathers or rather affirmes, that therefore God hath
rejected them, and in their roome hath elected the onely offering of Chriſt.
This he proves by a teſtimony taken Pſal. 40.6. Where David, and under the
perſon of David Chriſt himſelfe is brought in, ſpeaking hereof. But in
this place there is a great queſtion, what ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by this
comming of Chriſt into the world. Yet the thing it ſelfe ſhewes, that
they are much miſtaken, who interpret this comming of the nativity or birth
of Chriſt. For it is apparent that we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words to
be ſpoken of Chriſt, then when he prepared and addreſſed himſelfe for
his ſacrifice, and to performe his offering in ſtead of the Legall
ſacrifices. <hi>Loe I come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to doe thy will, O God.</hi>
This comming therefore of Chriſt into the world muſt be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
as to be joyned with the execution of Gods will. But this cannot be ſaid of
Chriſts nativity, for Chriſt preſently upon his birth did not performe
this will of God, which the Author deſignes; ſeeing then he could not doe
any will of God at all. For when hee was new borne and yet an Infant, how could
he doe the will of God? or could he then ſay theſe words? For it is
apparent that the Author ſpeakes here of Chriſt as man, which we therefore
intimate, that no man may thinke here to flye to the deſtinction of his
natures. Beſides, this phraſe of comming into the world, doth no where
ſignifie his nativity. For they who for this ſence of the phraſe bring
the place, John 1.9. do not obſerve, that the Greeke words
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if wee reſpect the
Grammaticall ſence, may as well bee referred to the preceding Noune
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies light, as to
the Noune <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is man: but if
we reſpect the phraſe of Scripture, then comming into the world, muſt
much rather be referred to the word <hi>light.</hi> So that the participle
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, muſt not be rendred in Latin
<hi>venientem,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to man, as the vulgar Latine edition hath it:
but <hi>veniens</hi> as refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>light.</hi> And ſo the ſence
made to be thus; That Chriſt who is the true light, riſing upon the earth
like the Sun, and comming into the world, doth enlighten every man with his
light, yet not preſently at his firſt riſing, but in proceſſe of
time; as the Sun carrieth his light from one part of the world to another, and
by degrees diſpels the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Compare this place with John 9.5. and
John 12.46. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine two opinions, which ſtrive, as I may ſay, for
the maſtery of the truth. The one is, that this comming of Chriſt into the
world ſhould be taken, for that his comming when he made his firſt entrance
among men to performe his miniſteriall office; The other is, that it be
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <pb n="209" facs="tcp:61860:108"/>of his entrance into the future world to
come, whereof this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor made mention before, chap. 1.2. and chap. 2.5. and
which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſingle name of the world, Rom. 4.13. Now the
arguments which ſeeme to perſwade us for the taking of it, not for this
preſent world, but for the future world to come, are chiefly three. 1.
Becauſe God did not abrogate thoſe Legall ſacrifices and offerings,
before Chriſt entered and came into that future world: but here the Author
ſpeakes of their abrogation. 2. Becauſe Chriſt ſaith, A body haſt
thou prepared me. For, how can this be applyed to Chriſts firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon his miniſteriall function in this world among men? Did Chriſt receive
from God a new body, and another different from what he had before, then when
he was firſt made knowne to the world by preaching of the Goſpel? And if
wee ſhould here underſtand that mortall body in which Chriſt firſt
preached the Goſpel, what would this make to the abrogation of the Legall
ſacrifices? Certainely, either nothing at all, or no way elſe but by many
turnings and windings. But if by this comming of Chriſt here, wee
underſtand his entrance into that future world to come, then theſe words
will much conduce to the matter. For, unleſſe God had given Chriſt a new
and incorruptible body, he could not have entered that dwelling of immortality,
and there have offered himſelfe to God, and appeare before him, neither could
he have ſitten at the right hand of this throne. Therefore ſeeing God would
abrogate and aboliſh thoſe earthly ſacrifices by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sacrifice
of Chriſt, for that purpoſe God fitted him a body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that heavenly
Sanctuary. For that the Author in citing this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, had a reſpect to
theſe words, is plaine by his words a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the tenth verſe,
where he mentions the offering of the body of Chriſt. By which forme of
ſpeech, ſeeinghe uſeth it no where elſe, he ſeemes as it were to
point at theſe words in this teſtimony, wherein God is ſaid to have
prepared a body for Chriſt. 3. Becauſe in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage of the 40.
Pſalme, a little before this teſtimony cited by the Author, David doth
ſing a ſong of thankſgiving unto God for his deliverance from a grievous
calamitie, ſaying, <hi>He brought me up alſo out of an horrible pit, out of
the miry clay, and ſet my feete upon a rock, and eſtabliſhed my goings;
and he hath put a new ſong in my mouth, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 40.2,3. If
therefore Chriſt may bee thought to have ſung theſe words of the Pſalme
with the reſt cited by the Author, after his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from death and the
grave; then might the Author well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Chriſt ſaid both theſe
and the reſt by him cited at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or entrance into that future world
to come. Now theſe words cannot be meant of Chriſts comming into the world
by his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead; becauſe when the Scripture ſpeakes of
his comming into this world, ſhe thereby uſually underſtands his being
made known unto the world: but Chriſt after and by his reſurrection was not
made <pb n="210" facs="tcp:61860:109"/>knowne unto the world, but was ſeene of a few
onely, who were to be witneſſes of it to the world. And therefore when the
time of his death drew neere, and of his departure to his Father after his
death, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe affirmed that he ſhould be no longer in the world.
<hi>He ſaith, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offering thou wouldſt not</hi>] Of the words
themſelves we ſhall ſpeake upon the next verſe, wherewith they wholly
agree in matter. But here let us enquire, why the Author affirmes, that
Chriſt then, when hee commeth into the world, ſaith theſe words? The
Author ſeemes to affirme this, from the following words which Chriſt
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth preſently after, <hi>Loe, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> ver.
7. For to what purpoſe did Chriſt come into the world, whether we
underſtand this world or that to come? If we underſtand this world, wee
muſt ſay, that Chriſt then when he came into this world, (or as the
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeakes before, chap 9.26. when firſt hee appeared) ſaid theſe
words unto God his Father; Becauſe the Legall ſacrifices and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
pleaſe thee not, therefore <hi>Loe, I am come, to do thy will, i.</hi> to
offer thee ſuch a ſacrifice, that is, wholly according to thy good will and
pleaſure. But if yee pleaſe to underſtand the future world to come, then
we muſt affirme, that Chriſt ſaid them, when he entered in thither;
Seeing, O God, thou doſt no longer approve the Legall ſacrifices, Lo, I
come to doe thy will, <hi>i.</hi> to offer up my ſelfe unto thee, that ſo I
may wholly expiate the ſinnes of thy people. For this is the will of God, and
the pleaſure of the Lord that ſhall proſper in the hand of Chriſt,
Iſaiah 53.10. That every one <hi>who ſeeth the Son and beleeveth on him,
ſhould</hi> be freed from the guilt and paine of all his ſinnes, and
<hi>have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> John 6.40. <hi>But a body haſt thou
prepared me</hi>] It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould thinke, that the Author
mentioned theſe words in reſpect of any ſence proper to his purpoſe,
but cited them onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtood connexed with the other words of
the teſtimonie which were pertinent to his intention. This hee himſelfe
ſeemes to intimate at the eighth and ninth verſes following, where in the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of this teſtimony, he leaves out theſe words, and takes only
the reſt that ſerve for his ſcope, which is this. That the Legall
ſacrifices are abrogate, and in their place the Sacrifice of Chriſt is
eſtabliſhed. Though at the tenth verſe following the Author ſpeakes of
the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Chriſt; yet it is not altogether neceſſary,
that wee therefore ſhould ſay, that he had reference to theſe words;
ſeeing the body of Chriſt might by an Hebraiſme be put for Chriſt
himſelfe. Againe, the Authour might have no reſpect to the proper ſence
of theſe words for this reaſon; becauſe in the Hebrew, other words are
read for them. But becauſe the Author followed the Greek Tranſlation,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alleaged the words as they ſtood in the Greeke, leſt men well
accquainted with the Greeke Tranſlation ſhould conceive that hee had
corrupted or changed the text; a rule that this Author hath obſerved in 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61860:109"/>other paſſages alſo (as hath been noted.) The
Hebrew text hath it, <hi>Mine eares haſt thou opened;</hi> wherein there is a
manifeſt alluſion to the cuſtome commanded by God; when any man would
give up himſelfe to perpetuall ſervitude, Exod. 21.6. A ſervant who at
the end of ſeven years ſervice would not be free, was by his maſter
brought to the door or door-poſt of the houſe, whereto his Maſter
faſtned him by boring his eare through with an awl; that this action might be
a teſtimony, that the party muſt perpetually remaine a ſervant to that
houſe and family; And this Ceremony was performed by the eare, that the
ſervant might remember to be alway ready to heare and obey; for by the eare
we heare, and hearing in the Hebrew ſignifies obeying; for as the Maſter
hath power to ſpeake and command, ſo the maine dutie of a ſervant is to
heare and obey. David therefore ſignifies by theſe words, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had received from God thoſe extraordinary benefits which before he had
reckoned up, therefore he would not offer unto God the ſacrifices of
beaſts, wherewith God was not much delighted, but would dedicate himſelf
for ever to the worſhip and ſervice of God; for this doth excellently well
agree with the following words of the Pſalme; ſeeing in them there is
nothing elſe ſaid but to this effect. This text and this ſence may fitly
be applyed to Chriſt comming into that future world; ſeeing alſo the Lord
Jeſus is as it were faſtned of God for ever to that heavenly Sanctuarie;
whereof (as the Authour hath ſhewed before) he is the Miniſter, there to
execute the will of God, and to procure both the ſervice of God, and our
ſalvation. Here a man may well wonder and demand, why the Septuagint in their
Greek Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould have it <hi>a body haſt thou prepared me,</hi>
ſo differing from the Hebrew text both in words and ſenſe. For
whatſoever other men think, it ſeemes no way reconcileable with the Hebrew
reading, which is now extant, and which we have now interpreted; for why is the
word <hi>bodie</hi> put for <hi>eares,</hi> and <hi>prepared</hi> for
<hi>opened;</hi> eſpecially when in the Hebrew words there is ſo clear,
ſo neat and elegant an alluſion to that cuſtome among the Iewes, whereby
a ſervant was bound to a perpetuall ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? We muſt therefore herein
ſay one of theſe two things; that either there was anciently ſome other
reading in the Hebrew, then what is now extant, eſpecially if there be ſome
neerneſſe of words, which in Hebrew ſignifie <hi>eares</hi> and
<hi>bodie;</hi> Or that the Greeke tranſlation of the Septuagint is altered
in this place as in many other. The former of theſe two wayes wee rather
approve, eſpecially becauſe, though it be not neceſſary, yet it is very
probable, that the Author in mentioning the offering of the bodie of Chriſt a
little after here, which hee no where elſe doth, might have a reſpect to
theſe words; For it is ſcarce credible he would have done ſo, if his
words had wholy receded from the truth in the Hebrew. But although wee would
willingly leave it to them who are more skilfull in the Hebrew tongue, to
conjecture <pb n="212" facs="tcp:61860:110"/>what the Hebrew reading might bee, that was
ſo neere this which is now extant, and induced the Septuagint to render it
thus in their Greeke tranſlation: yet wee muſt not ſo caſt this labour
upon others but that wee alſo endeavour ſomewhat in the matter, and
ſubmit our conjecture to the judgement of others. Concerning therefore the
word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>prepared,</hi> wee need
not much trouble our ſelves, ſeeing the Hebrew word <hi>Carah,</hi> may
alſo ſignifie to cut or carve; and by a Metaphor to faſhion, ſhape or
fit the whole into his parts and members; by a ſimilitude taken from
Statuaries, Carvers or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who by cutting, carving, graving, and
punching, or (as I may ſay) by digging, doe prepare, faſhion and ſhape
Statues or others pourtraits; which in Greeke is rightly termed
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now if to this Verbe there be
adjoyned a Noune, which may note a <hi>bodie,</hi> then the ſence will be
very proper. Wherefore now wee muſt thinke of the Greeke word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a body; for which in the Hebrew
wee now read <hi>oznaim,</hi> eares. And to this, the word <hi>geviah</hi>
often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Scripture, and ſignifying a body, is of neere affinitie.
For from the word <hi>oznaim</hi> take the firſt letter <hi>Aleph,</hi> which
might eaſily ſlip away, and the letters remaining are very like thoſe
which make <hi>geviah</hi> ſignifying a body; as they will eaſily
acknowledge, who will pleaſe to write both theſe words in Hebrew
characters. But let the more learned in the language conſider further of the
matter. For there is no repugnancy, that both their readings might be
conſonant to the mind of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; both anciently received. And
if the Hebrew text had this reading which wee have ſignified, or ſome other
like it, then with much elegancy theſe words may be taken of that
incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible body of Chriſt, which he received of God. The word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not ſignifie to adapt, by
joyning and fitting one thing to another, as they would have it, who ſay that
theſe words doe ſignifie the adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and joyning of Chriſts body to his
divine nature in his mothers wombe: but the word properly ſignifies to
faſhion or ſhape a thing, by giving it all it due members and joynts,
proportioning them ſo fitly one with another, that thereby the thing is
perfected and finiſhed. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offering thou wouldeſt
not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>In burnt offerings and ſacrifices for ſinne,
thou haſt had no pleaſure</hi>] Theſe words with the other of like nature
in the former verſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce mainly and properly to that purpoſe here of
the Author, for which he cited this teſtimony out of the 40. Pſalm. The
literall ſenſe, David would ſhew himſelfe moſt really thankfull unto
God, for an extraordinary benefit and deliverance, which the Lord hath
conferred on him, in bringing him out of an horrible pit, and ſetting his
feet upon a rocke. Yet he would teſtifie his thankfulneſſe and memory of
ſo great a benefit, not with ſacrifices and offerings of beaſts, but with
obſequies and ſervices of his perſon. The myſticall ſence is:
Chriſt <pb n="213" facs="tcp:61860:110"/>brought in, ſpeaking the like words, hath no
intent thereby to teſtifie thankfulneſſe unto God; but only to ſhew,
that he would offer unto God another kinde of ſacrifice, which ſhould be
moſt acceptable and agreeable unto God, ſeeing God had no pleaſure in the
legall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. And yet there is alſo another difference; for in the
literall ſenſe David ſaith not that God was abſolutely diſpleaſed
with thoſe legall ſacrifices, and would offer unto God no ſacrifices at
all of any beaſt; for ſuch a ſaying during thoſe times had been falſe
and evil: but he ſpeaks comparatively; as if he had ſaid, Thou art not, O
God, much delighted and pleaſed with the ſacrifices and offerings of
beaſts: but there are other things that delight and pleaſe thee more; for
thou wouldeſt rather have obedience then ſacrifice: Therefore I will rather
offer my ſelfe unto thee, and be a ſervant for ever to thy will. For to
like purpoſe Samuel ſpake to Saul; <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in
burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold
to obey, is better then ſacrifice; and to hearken, then the fat of Rams. For
diſobedience is as the ſinne of witchcraft, and ſtubborneſſe is as
wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Idolatary,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22,23. But in the myſticall
ſenſe, Chriſt ſaith abſolutely, that God had no further will to them,
and tooke pleaſure in them no longer, but his will and pleaſure was they
ſhould be antiquated and abrogated. Of this myſticall ſenſe, this is a
good argument, that Chriſt is here brought in, to mention not only
ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thankſgiving, which only were pertinent to Davids purpoſe;
but alſo expiatory offerings and ſacrifices for ſinne: whereof if wee
reſpect Davids intent, there ſhould here be made no mention. For Davids
intent was a teſtification of his thankfulneſſe unto God, and not an
expiation of his ſins at that time. But becauſe the Holy Ghoſt would wrap
up a myſticke and deep ſenſe in theſe words; therefore the Author doth
here ſpecifie and reckon up all kindes of ſacrifices and offerings
whatſoever, which are reduced to three ſorts. 1. By ſacrifice and
offering in the fifth verſe, he ſeems to underſtand, all offerings
eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical or of thankſgiving; whereof a part went to God, as the bloud
and the fat; part was a Fee to the Prieſt, and the reſt returned to him
that offered it. 2. By burnt offerings in this verſe, are underſtood
thoſe which were wholly burnt and went wholly to God; which are ſometime
called ſacrifices of praiſe, becauſe they were offered wholly in honour
of God, as he was the Lord Almighty, and not by way of ſpeciall
thankſgiving for any particular benefit then received from God; which was the
proper conſideration for a ſacrifice of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 3. By ſacrifices
for ſinne, are meant all expiations or offerings to put away the guilt and
puniſhment of ignorances and infirmities; for which kinde of ſins only
thoſe ſacrifices were allowed, and in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew are oftentimes called
ſimply ſins.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Loe I come</hi>] This word of
comming doth ſhew a <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61860:111"/>myſticall ſenſe. For how did
David come, when hee ſpake this word in the literall ſenſe? Therefore in
the literall ſenſe, it ſignifies only, Loe I am at hand, or I am ready; I
have prepared my ſelf to do thy will. But in the myſticall and proper
ſenſe, it ſignifies the appearance of Chriſt in that future world, to
execute the will of God. <hi>In the volume of the booke it is written of
me</hi>] In theſe words David ſhews the cauſe, why he is ready to doe the
will of God; or if ye pleaſe, the manner and way of his obeying God; <hi>q.
d.</hi> I am ready to doe as it is written of me in the volume of the booke; or
elſe, for ſo it is written of me that I ſhould doe thy will. Therefore in
theſe words we muſt underſtand, either ſome particle of likeneſſe,
<hi>as, according;</hi> or ſome caſuall particle, <hi>for, becauſe,</hi>
or <hi>ſeeing:</hi> for ſuch particles are oftentimes concealed or
ſilenced. But here againe, we meet with another difference betweene the Greek
tranſlation, and the Hebrew text. In the Hebrew it is, <hi>in the volume of
the booke,</hi> which hath a plaine and an open ſenſe; for by the booke he
eminently underſtands the booke of the Law, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a volume,
becauſe unciently the Law was wont to bee written in skinnes of parchment or
velum, one glued to another, and ſo rolled up and unrolled in the forme of a
Court-role, which in Latine is properly called <hi>Volumen,</hi> from the
rolling of it; and hence bookes are called Volumes. A famous Expoſitor among
the Romaniſts, preferres the Greeke reading in this place before the Hebrew;
and writes, that <hi>it is a vaine repetition to ſay in the volume of the
booke for that is all one as to ſay, in the booke of the booke.</hi> This is
a vame cavill; for all volumes or rolles are not bookes, but there are volumes
and rolles of many other things beſides. So that the word booke is fitly
added to volume, to ſpecifie the differences of volumes. We meet with a like
phraſe, Jer. 36.2. But why doth the Greeke tranſlation read it, in a
Chapter of the Booke? The reaſon may be, becauſe the Hebrew word
<hi>Megillah,</hi> doth not only ſignifie a whole booke conſiſting of
many skinnes, but alſo any one ſingle skinne, which may containe only
ſome Chapter of the Booke. And therefore the Greek Tranſlator conceived,
that he ſhould not go from the ſenſe of the words, if for the whole
volume, he ſhould put on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome part or certain Chapter of it;
eſpecially becauſe by this means the redundancie in words would ſeem the
leſſe or none at all; yet ſome there would ſeeme to be, if he had
ſaid the volume, and that had been taken to ſignifie the whole booke.
Wherefore theſe words muſt bee taken as if he had ſaid, In a Chapter of
the booke, namely of the Law it is written of me. By which meanes, not onely
all ſhew of redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy is taken away, but alſo a more ſpeciall place is
deſigned, where the thing is written, that is here ſpoken. Now let us a
little enquire, what Chapter this might bee? Certainly other Chapter it can be
none, but that, wherein the very thing is handled, which David ſaid, he came
to doe; <hi>i.</hi> that David ſhould doe the will of God. For wee 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61860:111"/>have ſaid, that in theſe words is ſhewed the
cauſe why David ſaid, hee came to doe Gods will, or the manner how hee
ſhould doe it. But where is it ſaid, that David muſt doe the will of God?
Namely there, where the Kings of Gods people are commanded to doe ſo; which
is ſet downe in the laſt parcell of the 17. Chapter of Deuteronomy from the
13. verſe to the end. For David in a peculiar way was ordained of God
himſelfe to bee the firſt King over Gods people, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was to
remaine in his poſterity for ever. And therefore hee ſaith, that there it
is written of him; not that it is there written of him by name as David, but
written of him as a King. And here alſo the Holy Ghoſt ſeems to have left
us ſome footſtep of a myſticall ſenſe. For it might be ſaid of
Chriſt properly, that there it is written of him by name; for the Holy
Ghoſt doth every where aim chiefly at Chriſt. Hence it appears, that they
are in an errour, who by a Chapter in the Booke, underſtand the beginning of
Geneſis; becauſe as they thinke there it is written of Chriſt, that he
created heaven and earth. But is there alſo any thing written of David? or of
Chriſt there, that hee ſhould doe the will of God? But in the 17. Chapter
of Deuteronomy before cited, among other things which God willed to be
obſerved by the future King of his people, this is alſo delivered, ver. 18.
And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the throne of his Kingdome, that he
ſhall write him a copy of this Law in a booke, out of that which is before
the Prieſts his Levites; <hi>And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read
therein all the dayes of his life; that he may learn to feare the Lord his God
to keep all the words of this Law, and theſe Statutes to doe them: That his
heart be not lified up above his brethren; and that he turne not aſide from
the Commandement to the right hand or to the left.</hi> All Gods Laws are his
will, for they are that will of God which God would have done; hee therefore
that doth Gods Laws, he doth his will. And ſeeing all the future Kings of his
people were to doe Gods will, as here it was writen of them; therefore David
alſo when he was become King was to doe the will of God as in this Chapter of
Gods Booke it was written of him. And therefore David againe, was to write
himſelfe a copy of the Law in a booke; he muſt read therein all the dayes
of his life; hee muſt keep all the words of it, and not lift his heart above
his brethren; for in doing theſe things he did the will of God, as it was
written of him in a Chapter of the Law. But ſome man may hereupon demand, how
ſhall this belong to Chriſt? muſt he write out a booke of the Law of
Moſes and perpetually read in it, and never depart from it? The Anſwer is
eaſie, That for the myſticall ſenſe we muſt not tye our ſelves to
every ſingle word, but only to the breviat and ſum of the matter, &amp;
that which is ſpoken properly of the type, muſt be ſo applied to the
antitype, as the nature of the antitype requires. The ſum of the matter in
this place is, That the King of Gods people muſt be obedient to Gods will;
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <pb n="216" facs="tcp:61860:112"/>to that will of God which God would have
him to obſerve, and conſequently to that Law of God which God would have
ſtand in force. As long as the Law of Moſes was in force, ſo long the
Kings over Gods people muſt obſerve that Law. But that Law being by God
abrogated, no man is bound to obſerve it, much leſſe is the King of Gods
people bound to it. And a new Law being ſurrogated, Gods people and their
King muſt obſerve that new Law. Wherefore the Law written in the Chapter of
that booke, muſt be ſo taken or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Chriſt, as the nature of
the thing will beare it, and as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and divinity of Chriſt
requires. Many things are ſaid of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which the perfection of the
body doth reject. But we muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve, that the ſence of the
words in this Pſalme may yet be further extended; ſeeing in the Hebrew
text, to the ſence whereof the Author might have more regard then to the
Greek Tranſlation, it is ſimply ſaid, <hi>In the volume of the booke,
i.</hi> of the Law; and although ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek Tranſlation, we
underſtand that Chapter of the Law, which we cited in Deuteronomy; yet that
very Chapter hath reference to the whole Law of God; or it referres the King to
all the words and precepts of the Law, which the King of Gods people was to
exccute. Wherefore in a myſticall ſence we may underſtand all thoſe
things, wherein Chriſt was to performe the will of God; and particularly
thoſe that belong to his expiatory Sacrifice, which here is the thing in
hand. Whence it is in a manner yet left doubtfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt ſaid
theſe words, when hee came into this world or the world to come. For, if by
this will of God wee underſtand nothing elſe but the ſacrifice of
Chriſt ſtrictly and properly taken, excluding his death from it, then we
muſt affirme, that Chriſt ſaid theſe things when he came into that
future world. But if we extend the ſacrifice or offering of Chriſt more
largely, and include his death, the neceſſary antecedent unto it, as in
this place it ſeemes wee muſt doe, and as wee have before intimated, that
wee may not ſet aſide the excellent and proper act of Chriſt himſelfe,
pertaining to his offering and ſacrifice moſt acceptable to God, ſeeing
he ſaith that he came to doe the will of God, and that we know that Chriſt
himſelfe had alſo his part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; then the thing it ſelfe declares,
that theſe words muſt be attributed to Chriſt when he came into this
world. And it is no obſtacle to this, that both according to the Greek
Tranſlation, and according to the literall ſence of the Hebrew words, we
reſpect that place, wherein the office of the King is deſcribed, whence
Chriſt as now made a King ſeemes to ſpeake theſe things, as David
alſo did. For, beſides that the Hebrew words of the Pſalme are more
large, as wee have ſaid, and therefore (eſpecially in the literall ſence)
may juſtly be more largely extended, this alſo muſt be marked, That
Chriſt although he were not yet a King actually, yet becauſe he was for
certaine to be one, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61860:112"/>to a Kingdome by Gods
immutable Decree, hee might very well even then referre to himſelfe, the
precept wherein the King of Gods people is commanded to do Gods will.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Above when he ſaid</hi>] From the words of
Chriſt, the Author fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferres, that the legall ſacrifices and
offerings were abrogated, and in their place the ſacrifice and offering of
Chriſt was inſtituted. And he ſhews this to be manifeſt from the very
manner of Chriſts words, and from the cleere oppoſition of the things
therein ſpecified. <hi>Above, i.</hi> in the firſt place, when he ſpake
of ſacrifices and offerings to be rejected, before he ſpake of his comming
to doe the will of God. <hi>Sacrifice and offering and burnt-offerings and
offering for ſin thou wouldſt not, neither hadſt pleaſure therein,
which are offered by the Law</hi>] The words <hi>which are offered by the
Law</hi>] muſt be read as included in a parentheſis, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Author
ſpecifies that the legall ſacrifices and offerings are abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated;
becauſe the ſacrifices and offerings, which Chriſt ſaith here, that God
would not have, neither had any pleaſure in them, and therefore muſt be
taken away, are no other but the legal ſacrifices which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by
the Law of Moſes, and were offered according to that Law.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Then ſaid he</hi>] Chriſt after he had ſpoken
the former words for the abrogation of the Legall ſacrifices, then hee added
theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For theſe are the words of the Author, relating the
words of Chriſt. <hi>Loe, I come to doe thy will, O God</hi>] Becauſe Gods
will was to abrogate the Legall ſacrifices, therefore Chriſt comes to do
that will and pleaſure of God, which God ſhould ſurrogate in ſtead of
the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſacrifices. <hi>He taketh away the firſt that he may
eſtabliſh the ſecond</hi>] <hi>q.d.</hi> What is this elſe, but to
abrogate the former, that he may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the latter? But that former
thing was the Legall ſacrifices, which Chriſt abrogates; the latter is the
will of God, which he eſtabliſheth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified</hi>] Here
he ſhews what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit we gaine, by this will of God, performed by Chriſt,
and eſtabliſheth in the place of the Legall ſacrifices. For, it might be
demanded, what doth this concerne us and the expiation of our ſins, that
inſtead of the Legall ſacrifices Chriſt ſaith he will do or hath done
the will of God? Therefore the Author ſhews, that this will of God and the
execution of it, doth conſiſt in the ſacrifice and offering of Chriſt
made for us: whence alſo this will of God is tacitly compared with the Legall
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and withall is preferred before them, as farre more excellent
and acceptable to God. Therefore he ſaith, that we are ſanctified by it;
even we, who (as he preſently addeth) are ſanctified by <hi>the offering of
the body of Chriſt</hi>] In which words, he withall teacheth what that will
of God is, namely; that it is the offering of the body of Chriſt once for
all; or at leaſt that it is altogether concurrent with this offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For,
how elſe ſhould we be ſaid to be ſanctified or expiated by this will of
God, ſeeing we are ſanctified by the offering of the body of 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61860:113"/>Chriſt. For this will of God ſeems to be oppoſed
thus far to the legall ſacrifices, that by it we are truly ſanctified. For
while our ſanctification is attributed to the will of God, as it ſtands
oppoſed to the legall ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is tacitely taken from them. As if
the Author had ſaid: By which wil of God we are ſanctified, &amp;not by the
old legal ſacrifices. The will of God is here put, not for the action of his
will, but for the object or matter of his wil, for the thing he would have
done, which he approves, and wherein he hath pleaſure; for it is oppoſed to
the legall ſacrifices; which he would not have done, which he approves not,
and wherein he hath no pleaſure. And therefore it ſignifies the ſacrifice
and offering of Chriſt, as the object or matter, which is now his will, as
the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing teach us. Sanctified, is explated, purged, and cleanſed
from our ſins: for which, ſee chap. 9.13. <hi>Through the offering of the
body of Ieſus Chriſt once for all</hi>] The offering, not of legall
ſacrifices often made, and yearely iterated, and therefore ineffectuall and
imperfect; but of the body of Chriſt once made, is that offering, which
greatly pleaſeth God, and is wholly conformable to his will, and truely
ſanctifieth us.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And every Prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring,
and offering often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſame ſacrifices</hi>] Hitherto hee hath
compared the offering of Chriſt with the legall ſacrifices, chiefly in
reſpect of the iteration, that the legall ſacrifices were offered often,
that is, yeare by yeare for the whole people: but that of Chriſt but once
only. Now he begins to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the high Prieſts together, namely, the old
with the new, the legall Prieſts with Chriſt; that they offered and
miniſtred yeare by yeare, but Chriſt once onely. For where there are many
ſacrifices ſucceſſively iterated yeare by yeare, there the high
Prieſt alſo muſt neceſſarily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and offer yeare by yeare:
but where there is but one ſacrifice or offering to be made, there the high
Prieſt miniſters and offers but once onely. For hitherto the author hath
intended onely this, to ſhew that Chriſt entring into his heavenly
Sanctuary; not to offer often accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the legall high
Prieſts, but to make one only offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as appeares in the former chapter,
verſe 25. For to this point as to his main ſcope all his arguments are
directed. The high Prieſt being en tered into the holy place, did not ſit
there, but was wont to <hi>ſtand</hi> there before the Mercy-ſeat, as
before the Throne of God. And hee ſtood there <hi>daily;</hi> which muſt
not be ſo underſtood, that he did ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in the yeare: but upon a
ſet and certaine day of the yeare, which had it circuit, and came about yeare
by yeare; namely, at the ſolemne anniverſary faſt for the univerſall
expiation of the whole people; for he daily offered upon that day; whenſoever
it had recourſe. For in this ſenſe he uſed the ſame word before chap.
7.27. where he openly ſpake of that ſolemne annuall ſacrifice upon the
day of Expiation; whereto he hath reference in this place alſo, as
particularly appeares from the third verſe of this chapter; where he mentions
the Commemoration of ſins <pb n="219" facs="tcp:61860:113"/>every yeare, which were
conſtantly confeſſed by the whole people at that ſacrifice. <hi>Which
can never take away ſins.</hi> The cauſe is here ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why the legall
high Prieſt muſt offer thoſe ſacrifices often; namely, becauſe they
could never take away ſinnes. <hi>i.</hi> They could never ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
free men from their ſinnes, that they who were once expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby,
ſhould have no further conſcience of ſinnes. And what this is, hath been
already explicated in this chapter, verſe 2.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>But this man after he had offered one Sacrifice
for ſins, for ever, ſat downe at the right hand of God.</hi>] Here he
oppoſeth Chriſt to the legall high Prieſt in three particulars. Firſt,
in that Chriſt offered for ſins but once onely; for he ſo offered, that
he never iterated his offering more. Secondly, in that after his offering, hee
ſat downe at the right hand of God. Thirdly, that he continued his ſeat
there for ever, even unto the end of the world. And theſe two latter
particulars are a reaſon of the former; for becauſe Chriſt ſitteth at
the right hand of God; and ſits there for ever to the worlds end; therefore
he ſhall never offer ſacrifice more. For how can it beſeeme, or rather
how can it befall ſo great a Majeſtie, to offer againe another Sacrifice,
that is, to die againe, and then againe to enter into heaven? For ſeeing
Chriſt ſitteth at Gods right hand for ever, therefore the Majeſtie of
Chriſt muſt continue for ever alſo; and then how can Chriſt ever offer
again? For then a thing laſteth for ever, when it hath a continuall duration
through all times and ages without any intermiſſion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be
made his footſtoole</hi>] Here he ſhewes the iſſue or effect that will
follow upon Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God. For thereupon it will
follow, that at the laſt, all his enemies ſhall be put under his feet, and
made his footſtoole. So farre ſhall Chriſt be from offering againe, to
bee violated and put to death againe by his enemies, that he expects their
ſubjection to him, to be made his footſtoole. And when all the enemies of
Chriſt (among whom death is the laſt and chiefeſt) ſhall be made his
footſtool, <hi>i.</hi> ſhall be wholy maſtered, yea aboliſhed, what
cauſe can there be why hee ſhould iterate his offering? That this
ſubjection will follow, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gathers it, from this ſaying of God
unto Chriſt, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy
footſtoole,</hi>] Pſalme 110.1. Therefore Chriſt ſitting at the right
hand of God doth expect this. And he ſaith, that Chriſt expecteth this,
fitting his words to the words of the Pſalme, wherein God himſelfe doth
vindicate this ſubjection of Chriſts enemies unto him, by putting them
under his feet. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee know, that Chriſt himſelfe neither
heretofore hath beene, neither now is, nor hereafter ſhall be vacant or
unoccupied in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither is this ſubjection attributed to God,
otherwiſe then as God doth it by Chriſt, or gives power and ſtrength unto
Chriſt, whereby he may and doth effect it; therefore in the word
<hi>expecting</hi> wee muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegde <pb n="220" facs="tcp:61860:114"/>a trope, and
the ſignification of it muſt be admitted onely thus far, as it argues; that
Chriſt by the gift and benefit of God, doth reigne &amp; ſubdue his enemies
to him: ſo that in this reſpect not Chriſt, but God is ſaid to ſubdue
his enemies, and Chriſt expecteth onely till it be done. Beſides in regard
of the time, wherein at laſt all the enemies of Chriſt ſhall be ſubdued
unto him, Chriſt may be ſaid thus farre to depend upon his Father, as it is
in his Fathers owne power to order the times and ſeaſons of things, or
Chriſt himſelfe doth teſtifie.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>For by one offering.</hi>] He brings another
reaſon why Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely but once; becauſe by one offering he
perfected or finiſhed all things. As on the contrary the legall high
Prieſts offered often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could never perfect all things by all
their oblations. <hi>Hee perfected for ever them that are ſanctified</hi>]
Perfected, is throughly and wholy expiated, ſee Chap. 7. ver. 11. For ever;
is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all future times and ages to come; not, as it was under the
Law, only for the time paſt, and that time but for the ſpace of one yeare.
They that are ſanctified, are they that are expiated, purged or cleanſed
from ſin in their conſcience: and the word muſt not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to
the preſent time only, but extended and dilated to all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of time,
to thoſe that ever have been ſanctified, or now are, or ever ſhall be.
For Chriſt may be ſaid to perfect or expiate men for ever in a double
ſenſe. Firſt, as every man that is expiated, is not expiated for ſome
certain time, but for ever: and ſecondly, as his offering is of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and
force to expiate all men of all times and ages to the end of the world; ſo
that it ſhall never need bee iterated either for the ſame men, or for any
others.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Whereof the Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſſe
to us</hi>] After that he had proved by ſeverall reaſons, that the offering
of Chriſt muſt bee made only once: now he further proves the ſame by a
teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth the
ſame thing. For this truth is ſo evident and ſo materiall, that it hath
not only the reaſons formerly alleadged to confirme it; but hath alſo a
teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein the Holy Ghoſt doth teſtifie it. The Holy
Ghoſt is ſaid to witneſſe a thing, when the Scripture ſaith it;
becauſe as Peter teacheth us, that <hi>holy men of God ſpake, as they were
moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>After that he had ſaid
before</hi>] After the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid before; which ſaying follows
in the next verſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>This is the Covenant, that I will make with them,
after thoſe dayes (ſaith the Lord) I will put my Lawes into their hearts,
and in their minds will I write thm</hi>] Of theſe words of the Holy Ghoſt,
we have treated before, Chap. 8.10.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>And their ſins and iniquities will I remember
no more</hi>] Between the former verſe, and this ſomething muſt be
underſtood, that is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced; namely, <hi>then he ſaid,</hi> as the
Author himſelf ſpeaks at the ninth <pb n="221" facs="tcp:61860:114"/>verſe before.
For at the fifthteenth verſe upon which this dependeth, the Author had
written, <hi>for after that he ſaid before</hi>] namely the Holy Ghoſt;
therefore here muſt be underſtood, <hi>then he ſaid;</hi> namely, the
Holy Ghoſt againe ſaid the words of this Text, <hi>And their ſinnes and
iniquities, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Now where remiſsion of theſe is, there is no
more offering for ſinne</hi>] From theſe words of the Holy Ghoſt, wherein
the remiſſion of ſinnes and iniquities is promiſed to Gods people; now
the Author inferres, that the offering of Chriſt muſt bee but one only.
Namely, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt doth teſtifie, that God under the New
Teſtament, and ſo by Chriſt and his offering, will remit unto his people
all ſinnes and iniquities even the moſt grievous for ever. Now where there
is ſuch a remiſſion of ſinnes, proceeding from Gods Will and Covenant,
and that univerſally in reſpect of time for ever, and alſo univerſally
in reſpect of perſons to all men, there can be given no other ſacrifice
for ſinnes, and therefore one ſacrifice only for ſinnes is ſufficient.
But that no further ſacrifice is allowed for ſins, where ſuch a
remiſſion of them is granted by Covenant, it appears from hence, becauſe
otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhould be granted and ordained alſo by Covenant
to them that perſiſt in their ſinnes; which were a thing very unfit and
unworthy of Gods grace. For if men repent and change their minde and wayes
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to better courſes, partly they abſtaine from ſinne with all care, and
partly by virtue of the new Covenant, and ſo by the one ſingle offering of
Chriſt, they have ready prepared for them a remiſſion of all thoſe
ſinnes, which either went before their true repentance, or to follow it, that
they neither loſe it, nor make it void. Anciently under the Law, when
remiſſion was granted only of ignorances and infirmities, it was no
marvell, if upon the ſtay or returne of the ſame ſinnes, for which
offering had been made, the offerings were often iterated; and inſtead of
them another offering were introduced far better and perfecter which is that of
Chriſt: but now ſeeing the moſt grievous ſinnes are expiated by the
offering of Chriſt under the New Teſtament, what place can be yet left for
any other offering? For either a man engaged by ſo great a benefit doth
afterward lead an holy life, or not. If he live holily, there needs no other
offering for to expiate his ſin, ſeeing hee commits it not: if he live not
holily, there muſt be none.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Having therefore brethren boldneſſe</hi>]
Here the Author doth in a manner ſumme up thoſe things, which hitherto he
had ſpoken of the Prieſthood and ſacrifice of Chriſt; and from thence
infertes his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing admonition. By boldneſſe here hee underſtands an
aſſured hope, and confidence flowing from the faculty and liberty granted
us of entring into heaven the moſt holy Sanctuary. So that by the word
<hi>boldneſſe</hi> is ſignified unto us both our faculty or liberty of
entring into heaven, and alſo our confidence or aſſurance of minde
iſſuing from our <pb n="222" facs="tcp:61860:115"/>knowledge of our faculty or liberty
to enter; which liberty is oppoſed to that reſtraint under the Law, whereby
it was lawfull for no man to enter into the holy place under paine of death,
except the high Prieſt once a yeare. And for feare that any one ſhould
attempt it, all were forbidden it. <hi>To enter into the holieſt.</hi> Heaven
is that Sanctuary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into on Gods part we have liberty that we may enter,
and on our owne part we have confidence that we ſhall enter. And of all
Sanctuaries the heavenly is abſolutely the holieſt; wherein it is oppoſed
to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Tabernacle, whereof one of the roomes was the moſt holy, yet
not abſolutely, but comparatively only in reſpect of the other, which was
called the firſt Tabernacle and the holy place, becauſe it was leſſe
holy then the ſecond, as the ſecond was farre leſſe holy then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is farre the holieſt of all. <hi>By the bloud of Ieſus.</hi>] For
from the bloud of Jeſus, wee draw our boldneſſe both for our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and
confidence to enter; becauſe both the New Teſtament, whereby is granted
unto us not only leave, but a right to enter into the holieſt, is confirmed
by the bloud of Jeſus: but alſo the new ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once only offered and
never to be iterated, for the offering where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt entered into the
holieſt, was prepared by the bloud of Jeſus. For by the entrance of Jeſus
into the holieſt, who is our leader and our head, we have liberty that we
may, and we take courage that wee ſhall enter: ſeeing whither ſoever our
leader and head whom God himſelfe hath appointed unto us, doth enter and
arrive, thither alſo a right and liberty of entring is granted unto us: for
not only the ſame iſſue of the journey is promiſed to us, that was
granted to our Captain and Head; but alſo therefore our Captaine entered
heaven and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all power there, that both from his example and from the
power he hath there, we might have an aſſured faith and hope of thoſe
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bleſſings, and in due time might really enjoy them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>By a new and living way which he hath
conſecrated for us</hi>] Here the Author ſeems to declare whence it is,
that we have our liberty and confidence to enter heaven; and he ſaith we have
it hence, That Chriſt hath conſecrated for us a way to it. Conſecrated
here is initiated or dedicated; for the Greek word is the ſame, that before
we rendred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, Chap. 9. v. 18. Now Chriſt is ſaid to conſecrate
or initiate this way unto us; not only as he was the firſt that entered
heaven after death, and a death ſo fearfull and ſhamefull; but alſo
becauſe hee hath procured us a right to the ſame way, that we may lawfully
paſſe along in it, and trace the ſteps of Chriſt to immortality: For
Chriſt hath conſecrated this way for us, by uſing it himſelfe firſt,
and then leaving the uſe of it free to us; for conſecration is the firſt
uſe of a holy thing, before which it might not lawfully bee uſed by any
other. Before Chriſt opened heaven by his entrance thither, and conſecrated
the way leading thither, it was lawfull for no man to enter it, eſpecially
after <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61860:115"/>death. But now this way being conſecrated,
dedicated, or initiated, any man that will, may enter it, and by it paſſe
ſafely unto heaven. This way is called new, not only becauſe it was lately
or newly conſecrated or initiated, but eſpecially becauſe it was lately
diſcovered and newly opened, even in the latter times and laſt age of the
world; and beſides, becauſe it is an appendent and concurrent with the New
Teſtament; for during the Old Teſtament and the old Tabernacle the way to
the holieſt was not open: <hi>The way into the holieſt of all, was not yet
made manifeſt while the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding,</hi> Chap.
9.8. This new way is ſo marked with the ſteps of Chriſt, that no length
of time can deface it; eſpecially ſeeing ſo many thouſands of the godly
have heretofore followed and hereafter will follow Chriſt their leader in
that journey; and the way by their ſteps is continually renewed and kept
open. And it is called a <hi>living way;</hi> not formally, but finally,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe life is the end of it whereto it leads; for ſo bread is called the
bread of life and living bread; becauſe effectually it doth vivifie and make
us live. Hee ſeemes herein to have a tacite reference to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into
the holy places under the Law, which was a mortall and deadly way, becauſe it
was death for any man to enter them, excepting only the high Prieſt, and he
but once a yeare, upon a prefixed day, to performe ſolemne ceremonies. And
therefore he oppoſeth the way to the heavenly holy place, to the way of the
old legall holy place; in as much as this latter is a deadly way that brings
death, but the former is a living way that leadeth unto life. Beſides, this
entrance and way lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the heavenly holy place is commonly made by death,
and ſometimes by a horrid and cruell death, and ſo may ſeem rather to
lead unto deſtruction; and therefore he called it a living way very
ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to comfort us by teaching us, that it hath a far different
iſſue from what it ſeems at the firſt ſight. <hi>Through the vaile,
that is to ſay his fleſh</hi>] Hee alludes to the vaile that was ſpread
between the two holy places of the Tabernacle, and diſparted the one from the
other: To which vaile he ſaith the fleſh of Chriſt is anſwerable. For
as the old legall high Prieſt could not enter into the moſt holy place
unleſſe the vaile were withdrawne: So Chriſt could not enter into the
heavenly holy place, before his fleſh was withdrawne, and as I may ſay,
rent and broken. Therefore the high Prieſt entered by moving the vaile
aſide, and Chriſt by laying his fleſh aſide; ſo Chriſt entered
through the vail. An open ſign whereof was in the death of Chriſt, whereby
his fleſh was diſſolved and laid aſide. For when Chriſt yeelded up
the ghoſt, ſuddenly the vail of the Temple was rent in twain. And this
renting of that vaile, what doth it portend elſe, then that by Gods
appointment, thoſe holy places ſhould be no more ſhut, but open and
common, and become in a manner of publicke uſe; ſo that any man might
lawfully either looke into or enter them? And hereby what elſe was
ſignified, <pb n="224" facs="tcp:61860:116"/>but that the fleſh of Chriſt being rent
and broken by the death of the Croſſe, thereupon the paſſage unto the
heavenly holy places was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked and ſet open to Chriſt, and to all that
beleeve in him? ſo that not onely Chriſt himſelfe might enter, but all
that are Chriſts may enter alſo, and before they enter actually, may looke
in by faith and hope. While the mortall body of Chriſt was entire and whole,
both Chriſt himſelfe was debarred from the entrance of thoſe heavenly
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and we both from the entrance and proſpect of them: but after that
this vaile of Chriſts fleſh was by death diſſolved, then both Chriſt
himſelfe did enter heaven, and procured us a right and power to enter, and
before we do enter actually, to view the happineſſe of it by faith, and
taſte the ſweeteneſſe of it by hope. For the entrance of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven following upon his death, doth make us certainely to ſee and hope for
the inheritance of heaven; which was hidden from us by Chriſt as by a vaile,
till he was withdrawne and taken from us by his death and Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>And having a great high Prieſt</hi>] Chriſt
is called a great high Prieſt, not onely in reſpect of the faithfull who
are but a kinde of leſſe Prieſts compared to Chriſt; as of old under
the Law among the Prieſts one was great and head over the reſt: but in
reſpect of the high and great Prieſts under the Law, who as we have heard,
compared with Chriſt, were not onely little, but in a manner very ſmall and
dimme ſhadowes. <hi>Over the houſe of God</hi>] By this houſe of God, we
may underſtand both that heavenly Sanctuary, wherein our high Prieſt
performes his holy offices, anſwerable to the Legall Tabernacle, and alſo
the Church or people of God, who are the ſpirituall houſe of God. For
Chriſt is preſident over both theſe houſes, both that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and
this ſpirituall on earth.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Let us draw neere</hi>] Here begins the other
part of the Chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an admonition drawne from the former
doctrines. They were ſaid to come or draw neere (as we heard at the firſt
verſe) who while the Prieſt was officiating, were intentive to the divine
ſervice, for which they approached to the Tabernacle, whereby they alſo
came neere or drew neere to God. The Author doth call upon us, That ſeeing we
have a high Prieſt truly great reſident in the Sanctuary of heaven, who
there performes holy offices &amp; offerings for us, therefore we alſo
ſhould approach and draw neere in ſoule and ſpirit unto that heavenly
San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary intentively minding the worſhip of God. Which is nothing elſe,
but to apply our ſelves to the worſhip of God, and never make doubt to draw
neere unto him in confidence of Chriſt our high Prieſt. <hi>With a true
heart</hi>] He ſhews what manner of perſons they muſt be, who will
exerciſe this ſpirituall worſhip of God, and apply themſelves unto it;
They muſt have a true heart. And a true heart is oppoſed to a ſeined,
deceitfull and diſſembling heart, which makes onely an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61860:116"/>ſhew of holineſſe, and thereby endeavours to
deceive. <hi>In full aſſurance of faith</hi>] A full aſſurance of faith
is oppoſed to a wavering and doubting faith; for looke how much doubt is
mingled with faith, ſo much is wanting to the perfection and fulneſſe of
it. Therefore then we have a full faith, when wee doubt nothing of the truth of
the Chriſtian Religion and diſcipline. <hi>Having our hearts ſprinkled
from an evill conſcience</hi>] He alludes to a Ceremony ordained under the
Law, whereby they who had touched any uncleane thing, muſt be ſprinkled
with the holy water of ſeperation, before they might enter into the
aſſembly of Gods people at the Sanctuary, to performe the worſhip of God;
for if they did otherwiſe they muſt dye for it. This purging or cleanſing
of the fleſh by ſprinkling, the Author transferres ſpiritually to the
ſpirit and ſoule, whereby the ſoule is cleanſed from the guilt and
ſtaine of conſcience, and the body from the filth of ſinne. Now the
ſprinkling or purging of the heart from an evill conſcience may be taken
two wayes; either to ſignifie that cleanſing whereby we get a full
remiſſion of our ſinnes by the bloud and ſacrifice of Chriſt, and are
freed from an evill conſcience and from feare of Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which
manner he ſaid before, that our conſcience is purged from dead works: or to
ſignifie the cleanſing of our ſoule from inward and ſecret ſinnes.
For by an evill conſcience in this place, by a meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my of the effect, he
ſeemes to underſtand the hidden and ſecret vices of the ſoule; as
oppoſed to the filth of the body, which as in the words immediatly
ſubſequent, he teacheth muſt be waſhed away. For, what elſe can the
filth of the body ſignifie, then thoſe outward ſinnes which are committed
by the body it ſelf? not as if theſe did not alſo defile the
conſcience, but becauſe open ſinnes are expoſed to the eyes and
cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of other men: but the ſecret and inward ſinnes of the ſoule,
though they make no man elſe conſcious to them, yet they agitate and burden
the conſcience. Therefore by the former ſence of theſe words is
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the great benefit of God, which we attaine by the bloud and
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt; and by the latter is intimated our duty whereto wee
are excited and oblieged by ſo great a benefit. <hi>And our bodies
waſhed</hi>] We have already ſaid, that this waſhing of the body muſt
be referred to the waſhing away of that filth, whereby our body ſtands
defiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; therefore if we receive the laſt ſence of the former
words, then the Author here puts us in minde of the ſame thing, whereof Paul
remembers us, 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes (dearely
beloved) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh
and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the feare of God.</hi> And the Author
ſhewes, that it is a moſt fit and convenient thing to waſh the body in
this ſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe anciently under the Law, they who approached to the
Sanctuary for the performance of Gods worſhip, muſt waſh their bodies;
all the difference is, that there men underſtood the carnall ſtaines of
ſinne, but <pb n="226" facs="tcp:61860:117"/>here the ſpirituall. <hi>With pure
water</hi>] There is no neceſſity we ſhould by this allegory thinke any
thing anſwering by name to this water; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author ſeemes to
ſpeake in alluſion to the cuſtome uſed under the Law of waſhing the
body with pure water. For, compariſons as we have often intimated are
ſubject to many abuſions. Yet if any man deſire a full reſemblance, we
may ſay that hereby is meant, the ſpirit and doctrine of Chriſt, or that
ſpirituall water, wherewith Chriſt ſprinkleth his people, not excluding
his bloud. For this is the pure water for the ſoule, and by it only the filth
of ſin is waſhed away. They that here underſtand the water of Baptiſme
are miſtaken. For the water of Baptiſme is but onely an outward ſigne and
ſhadow of this waſhing which here the Author underſtands, wherewith
neither can our hearts be ſprinkled, nor the filth of our vices really
waſhed away. Therefore that ſpirituall Baptiſme which doth truly ſave
us, muſt be here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, even that Baptiſme which as Peter ſaith,
<hi>is not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> or the outward
waſhing of the body, <hi>but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good conſcience toward
God,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.21. Which is not effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any elementary water, but
only the heavenly and ſpiritual which waſheth the conſcience.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſsion of our
faith.</hi>] He exhorts them to conſtancy in the profeſſion of the
Chriſtian religion; becauſe it is not ſufficient for us, to ſerve God
in heart and other workes, unleſſe wee alſo confeſſe him with the
mouth. In the Greeke it is, the profeſſion of our <hi>hope;</hi> and by the
word <hi>hope,</hi> the Author ſeemes to compriſe the whole Chriſtian
religion; for the Chriſtian religion conſiſteth chiefly in hope, and in a
hope moſt excellent, even the hope of immortall life, and eternall happines;
and all the parts and heads are directed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to breed in mens mindes
this hope, and a holineſſe of life ſutable to it. Hence Peter under the
ſame name of hope ſeems to comprehend all the heads of our Chriſtian
profeſſion, 1. Pet. 3.15. <hi>Without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> We muſt hold this
hope ſo faſt, that wee neither decline from it our ſelves, nor ſuffer
our ſelves to be beaten from it by any engins of temptation or affliction.
<hi>For he is faithfull that promiſed.</hi>] Hee inſerts the cauſe, why
we ſhould hold faſt the profeſſion of our hope without wavering;
namely, becauſe this hope is grounded both upon a promiſe, and a promiſe
of him that is faithfull to performe it, namely, of God himſelfe. God is
therefore termed faithfull, becauſe he keeps his faith, <hi>i.</hi> He
alwayes performes whatſoever hee hath undertaken for his part; and never
diſappoints his people of his help and favour. Therefore we are never to
doubt of Gods faith, ſo we keepe our owne, and performe our parts with all
care and diligence.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>And let us conſider one another</hi>] This may
be underſtood, that we ſhould looke unto both one anothers ſtate and
condition of life, and alſo one anothers behaviour and action: And for what
end wee ſhould <pb n="227" facs="tcp:61860:117"/>doe this, hee preſently ſhewes, in
adding. <hi>To provoke unto love</hi>] To provoke, is to intend or increaſe
the force of a thing: and love is then provoked, when it is quickened and
increaſed. And it gathers increaſe from our mutuall conſideration and
inſpection, either in our ſelves or others. In our ſelves it is
increaſed, when wee are either ſtirred up by the notable examples of other
men, or moved by their ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to embrace them with more ardent
affection and good will: if their eſtate be proſperous, that wee doe not
onely envie them, but uſe our endeavour to defend and advance their
happineſſe to our power: but if they are in diſtreſſe, that we
ſuccour and benefit them in what we are able. In others love is increaſed,
when we look into their lives and manners for this end, that where they grow
negligent in their duties, or ſuffer their love to decay, there by our
admonitions and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we excite to good workes, and to repaire the
decayes of their love. Therefore this provoking to love, may be taken either
paſſively, when the increaſe of love is made upon our ſelves, or
actively, when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it upon others. <hi>And to good workes</hi>] Then
we are provoked to good workes, when we follow them with an ardent affection,
or as Paul would have us, when wee are zealous of good workes. Hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
good workes to love, to teach us that our love ſhould not be barren, but
fruitfull of workes; although workes may be taken more largely, and extended to
all workes of holineſſe, as well concerning God as our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling of our
ſelves together.</hi>] Namely, for this eſpeciall end to retaine and
preſerve, the communion of Saints, and the unity of the Spirit. Which is then
done, when Chriſtians meet together to performe the worſhip of God, to
heare his word, to powre forth unanimous prayers unto him, to exerciſe that
cenſure of manners, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have preſcribed, to
celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſts death, by ſacred breaking of bread
according to his own inſtitution; to make a common ſupply for the poore and
diſtreſſed as occaſion requires, and with all their forces and advices,
to promote the affaires of the Church. <hi>As the manner of ſome is.</hi> It
is apparent, that in thoſe times there were ſome, who though they had not
forſaken the Chriſtian religion, yet had forſaken the aſſemblies of
the faithfull; that they might the better lie hid, and thereby more eaſily
avoide dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and perſecutions. And it is apparent alſo hence, that they
ſinne grievouſly, who withdraw themſelves from the company of the
faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and from the aſſemblies of the Saints. <hi>But exhorting one
another</hi>] To the neglect of aſſembling, hee oppoſeth this mutuall
exhorting or admoniſhing. Whence it is manifeſt that Chriſtian
aſſemblies were ordained among other ends for this alſo, to exhort and
admoniſh one another; which may be done moſt opportunely, when men are
aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into ſome one place. <hi>And ſo much the more as yee ſee
the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</hi>] <pb n="228" facs="tcp:61860:118"/>The words ſo much the more
muſt alſo be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the day of approaching, as well as referred
to the exhorting; By how much the more ye ſee the day approaching, by ſo
much the more let us exhort one another. By <hi>the day,</hi> as the article
<hi>the</hi> doth intimate, muſt be underſtood ſome certaine day, and
that well knowne; <hi>i.</hi> the day of judgement, and puniſhment for the
diſobedient: Which judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeeing it is twofold, we muſt needs
underſtand a twofold day or time of it. For we may take it both for the time
of Gods taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the Jewes in the finall deſtruction of
Jeruſalem; and alſo for the laſt day of the whole world at the finall
deſtruction of the world. The approach of that former day, they might
eaſily perceive, both from the ſignes foretold by Chriſt, and alſo from
the predictions of thoſe Prophets, who lived in thoſe times in the Church
of God. The approach of this latter day, every man ſees, though not in
reſpect of the whole world, and of the preſent age, yet every man ſees it
in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelfe. For as death is alwayes approaching unto every one
of us, and the terme of every mans life draws nearer: ſo alſo thereby every
mans laſt day doth approach and draw nearer; not only becauſe after death
there ſhall bee no change in reſpect of our ſalvation and damnation; but
alſo becauſe that whole time intercurrent between the laſt moment of our
life and the laſt judgement, is none in reſpect of the dead. For when we
are dead, and thereby void of all ſenſe of time, the laſt moment of our
life departing, and the firſt moment of our life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning (for returne it
ſhall at the laſt judgement) will ſeem one and the ſame to us at our
riſing againe to life. They who lye in a deep ſleep are not ſenſible of
the time that paſſeth, though the time be very long; and death is a deeper
ſleep then any ſleep of thoſe that ſleep alive. And this is the cauſe
why the holy Scriptures doe ſometime ſpeake ſo, as if we ſhould wholy
live till the comming of Chriſt, or were preſently after our death
tranſlated to the Lord, and ſo to the joyes of heaven: For they have no
regard of the time intercurrent between the laſt end of our life, and the
comming of Chriſt, and the future happineſſe of the godly; ſee 2 Cor.
5.8. and Epheſ. 4.30. and Phil. 1.6,26. and 1 Tim. 6 14. and Jam. 5.7,8. and
ſome others.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>For if we ſinne wilfully</hi>] Hee brings a
cauſe or a motive, why they ſhould diligently exhort one another, becauſe
otherwiſe it might eaſily fall out, that after knowledge of the truth
received they might ſin wilfully, in which caſe how miſerable and unhappy
their condition would be, he preſently declares. To ſin in this place may
be taken in two ſenſes, either largely or ſtrictly. Largely, as it is
extended to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſins which are committed againſt the Commandements of
Chriſt. Strictly, as it eminently ſignifies the moſt grievous ſin of
Apoſtacie, which is a falling away from the Chriſtian Religion, or rather
infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in generall; whereto if by way of difference, yee adde what the 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61860:118"/>Author preſently addeth, <hi>after knowledge of the
truth received,</hi> ye have the definition of Apoſtacie: For Apoſtacie is
an Infidelity that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes after faith; or a deſertion of the faith, and a
rejection of the truth once knowne and received. So John 16.9. Chriſt by the
word ſinne ſeems eminently to underſtand Infidelity. The latter ſenſe
is favoured, 1. In that the Author, ver. 28. following, being to prove that men
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the manner here ſpecified, ſhall by no meanes eſcape the
judgement of God, ſeemes to draw his argument from them, who wholy rejected
Gods Law, and turned to falſe Gods; of whom wee read, Deut. 17. and whom no
men reſemble neerer, then they who fall away from Chriſt, and his moſt
holy Religion. 2. In that it ſeems proper to Apoſtates, to tread under foot
the Son of God, and to account the bloud of the Covenant an unholy thing; for
this is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to them who conſtantly adhering to the Chriſtian
Religion, are notwithſtanding fallen into ſome ſingle ſin or vice. 3.
In that this place ſeems moſt alike to that, Chap. 6.4. where we have
ſaid the Author ſpeaks properly of Apoſtates. But the former ſenſe is
alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; 1. In that the word Sinne hath a generall ſignification,
and perhaps every where; for words muſt not be reſtrained within the uſe
of ſpeech, when no reaſon conſtraines it. And the word Sinne in the place
of John 16.9. hath of it ſelfe a generall ſignification, though afterward
it be ſpecified and explicated in particular what kinde of ſin he there
underſtands. 2. From the occaſion and ſcope of the Author: For before he
had admoniſhed them to exhort one another; and now he ſhews, what great
danger will or at leaſt may come of it, if this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be neglected; namely,
that they may wilfully ſinne after they have received the knowledge of the
truth; and ſo involve themſelves into a heavy judgement. And ſeeing the
Exhortation is at large, as muſt bee uſed as a remedy againſt all kinde
of ſinnes; why therefore ſhould not that ſin which the Author faith might
eaſily ariſe from the neglect of exhortation, be extended largely alſo?
Now in anſwer of the reaſons brought for the other ſenſe. To the
firſt: we ſay that the Authors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſeems drawne from all them who
ſinned againſt the Law with a high hand; of whom there is a place, Numb.
15.30,31. <hi>But the ſoul that doth ought preſumptuouſly (whether he be
borne in the land, or a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) the ſame reproacheth the Lord, and that
ſoule ſhall be cut off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people; Becauſe he hath
deſpiſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his Commandement; that
ſoule ſhall ſurely be cut off, his miquity ſhall be upon him.</hi> For
to deſpiſe the Law here in this Author, is the ſame with deſpiſing
the word of the Lord, and breaking his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement with Moſes in Numbers.
Here, to ſinne wilfully, and there to doe preſumptuouſly are all one. And
here, ſhall dye without mercy, and there, he ſhall ſurely be cut off, are
all one, for what is this elſe, but not to ſpare, not to ſhew any mercy.
To the ſecond we ſay, <pb n="230" facs="tcp:61860:119"/>That he doth tread under foot
the Son of God, and account the bloud of the Covenant an unholy thing, who
dares violate the Covenant, which is publiſhed by Chriſt, and
eſtabliſhed by his bloud, or dares as much as in him lyes to irritate or
diſſolve it, that it may be void and of no effect; by committing thoſe
ſinnes, which by the Covenant are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by death and damnation. To the
third we ſay, That this place is not ſo altogether like that Chap. 6.4. but
that there appears a plaine unlikeneſſe. For there both the ſcope and
occaſion of the words, and the word it ſelfe of <hi>falling away,</hi>
compared with the matter preceding doe all declare, that the Author properly
ſpeaks of Apoſtacie; but here as we have ſeene, the ſcope and
occaſion of the words tend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Wherefore we muſt conclude, that
the former acception of the word <hi>Sin,</hi> which includes in it alſo the
latter, is rather to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Although amongſt thoſe ſinnes
Apoſtacie holds the firſt place, and thereto the Author hath reference
chiefly, but not only. The word <hi>wilfully</hi> as we have ſaid, ſeems to
ſignifie the ſame ſinne, that the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament call
<hi>preſumptuouſly;</hi> and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in contempt of Gods Majeſty,
or by hautineſſe and pride of minde; and this kinde of ſinne, is
oppoſed to ſinnes committed either out of ignorance or infirmity: Wherefore
it notes unto us thoſe kinde of ſinnes which are wittingly, adviſedly and
purpoſely; and ſo argue a meer malice of mind. Such under the New
Teſtament are accounted all vitious habits and cuſtomes of ſinning, and
perſevering in evill-doing; as alſo all heynous and foule wickedneſſes,
done wittingly and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. For infirmity, or humane frailty cannot be
pretexed for ſuch ſinnes eſpecially among Chriſtians. <hi>After that we
have received the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Sinnes wilfully and wittingly
committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knowledge of the truth, are of another nature, then
thoſe that follow that knowledge; for the Sacrifice of Chriſt was ordained
to expiate the former; but for the expiation of the latter, there is no other
ſacrifice to be expected, as wee ſhall heare afterward. For crimes or foule
ſinnes committed after the knowledge of the truth, are far more heynous then
thoſe done in ignorance of it; and the malice of man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares far greater in
thoſe then in theſe, though otherwiſe the facts may be equall. Therefore
it more agrees with the equity and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, to grant a meanes for the
expiation of thoſe, then of theſe, and conſequently to pardon thoſe,
and not theſe. <hi>There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes.</hi> In
theſe words is expreſſed the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of thoſe, who after
knowledge of the truth received, ſinne in the manner we have ſaid; namely,
that ſeeing the ſacrifice and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſt did not profit them,
there remaines no other wherby their ſinnes may be expiated. But the
ſacrifice and offering of Chriſt profited them not, becauſe they are
relapſed into their former ſinnes, and bring not forth fruit worthy of
faith and repentance. <pb n="231" facs="tcp:61860:119"/>For upon this condition only it is,
that the ſacrifice and offering of Chriſt bringeth ſalvation to them who
live after their knowledge of the truth, and their reception of the Chriſtian
faith. For ſins committed before the knowledge of the truth, may be waſhed
away by faith only in Chriſt, and the profeſſion of it, and a purpoſe,
and as it were a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of living holily afterward: but ſins done after
ſuch knowledge are no otherwiſe waſhed away, but by an actuall and totall
deſertion or forſaking of them, and by inducing in their roome all
Chriſtian virtues as fruits of the Spirit and of faith. For this is it which
the Apoſtle hath left written unto us, Gal. 5.18. <hi>But if yee be lead by
the Spirit, yee are not under the Law. Now the workds of the fleſh are
manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery fornication, uncleanneſſe,
taſciviouſneſſe; Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations,
wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, murders, drunkenneſſe,
revellings, and ſuch like: of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo
told you in time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit
the Kingdome of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long
ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, weekneſſe, temperance,
againſt ſuch there is no Law. And they that are Chriſts have crucified
the fleſh with the affections and luſts. If we live in the Spirit, let us
alſo walke in the Spirit.</hi> Now what can bee more cleare, then that
theſe words doe openly teach, that all they, who after they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the faith of Chriſt, doe follow the workes of the fleſh, and are not lead
by the Spirit of God, ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God, nor avoid
eternall damnation? And therefore if they will aſpire to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they
muſt with all ſpeed lay aſide their vices, and bee effectually adorned
with Chriſtian virtues. For in this place here, the Author ſeems not to
teach, that men ſinning wilfully after knowledge of the truth, ſhould have
no hope at all leſt of pardon and ſalvatoin; but only that they have none,
till they actually put off their ſinnes, and qualifie themſelves with
ſuch virtues as become Chriſtians. For unleſſe they doe this, he
ſaith plainly, that the ſacrifice and offering of Chriſt will no way doe
them good. Seeing beſides, that one only ſacrifice and offering of
Chriſt, there remaines no other to be expected; as his words fully declare,
in that he ſaith, <hi>there remaineth no more ſacrifice; q. d.</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that one only offering of Chriſt whereof we have treated
hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, there remaineth no other for them. Whence further it ſeems that by
theſe words, all hope of converſion is not cut off to ſuch as ſinne
wilfully after their knowledge of the faith; but only all hope of pardon and
ſalvation is ſo long cut off, as they forſake not their ſinfull
courſes, and doe not the workes of true piety worthy of Chriſtian
repentance. Although it is moſt true, that ſome ſinnes are ſo foule,
among which is Apoſtacie, and ſuch as have neare affinity with it (whereof
we ſpake Chap. 6.) that if we looke into the nature of the New Covenant, wee
may well ſay, that there is no hope of coverſion from them; becauſe 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61860:120"/>without the ſpeciall mercy of God, not comprehended in
the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the yoke of ſuch ſinnes cannot be looſed and cut off.
<hi>Sacrifice for ſinnes</hi>] is ſacrifice whereby ſinnes are expiated,
as appeares by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe, whereto this ſacrifice for ſinnes is
oppoſed a certaine fearfull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation.
Wherefore as in theſe laſt words puniſhment is ſignified; ſo in the
former is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don intimated.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>But a certaine fearefull looking for of
judgement</hi>] Here he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates his former negation, by an affirmation
of the contrary. To them who after knowledge of the faith ſin wilfully, there
remaines no more ſacrifice for their ſins, but there remaines for them a
fearfull looking for of judgement. Judgement is here as in many other places
taken by a metonymy, for puniſhment; becauſe by judgement puniſhment is
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed. It is not neceſſary wee ſhould take expectation or <hi>looking
for</hi> properly here; ſeeing men given to ſinne, if wee reſpect their
minds and thoughts, do for the moſt part expect or looke for nothing
leſſe, then puniſhment and damnation. Therefore ſuch men are ſaid to
looke for judgement metaphorically, becauſe for certaine a judgement
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines unto them; or metonymically, becauſe they ought to looke for it.
This expectation or <hi>looking for</hi> is called fearfull in regard of the
object, becauſe the judgement or puniſhment looked for, or remaining to
them, is for the greatneſſe of it, horrible and fearefull. <hi>And fiery
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi>] In theſe words he expreſſeth what the fearefull
judgement or puniſhment ſhall be, that remaines to ſuch as ſin wilfully
after their knowledge of the faith; namely they ſhall be caught and devoured
by an extreame hot fire, whereinto God will caſt them in his indignation.
There is no doubt, but by theſe words is ſignified that laſt judgement or
puniſhment which in the laſt judgement muſt be inflicted upon all
evill-doers. For wee know, they ſhall be tormented, with mighty flames of
fire, and deſtroyed for ever; although we exclude not other puniſhments of
God in this life, which uſe to be the fore-runners of that horrible vengeance
to come. For of all puniſhments, that by fire, is moſt fearefull and
horrible; and therefore is uſed to ſignifie the moſt grievous and
wrathfull puniſhments. In the Sermons of the Prophets, when there is ſpeech
of ſome grievous judgements or puniſhments of God, many times fire is
mentioned, See Deut. 32.22. and Job 15.34. and Job 20.26. and Pſal. 11.7. and
Pſal. 21.9. and Pſal. 78.21. and Pſal. 97.3. and Pſal 140.10. and
Iſaiah 10.16. Iſaiah 26.11. and Iſaiah 30.33. The anger alſo or wrath
of God is in Scripture called a fire; and among other paſſages in the 12.
chapter following, God himſelfe by reaſon of the wrath wherewith he burnes
againſt the ungodly is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a conſuming fire. And in this place, by
fiery indignation, which ſhall devoure the adverſaries of God, is
underſtood the wrath of God. <hi>Which ſhall devoure the
adverſaries</hi>] The adverſaries of God are they <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61860:120"/>that alwayes were his enemies and never ſubmitted unto him; or they
that having once ſubmitted, doe afterward rebell againſt him. Such are they
who conſtantly reject the Religion of Chriſt, or having once received it,
afterward forſake it, or receiving and retaining it, doe not ſubmit their
ſoules to the precepts of it.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law</hi>] He
confirmes his former aſſertion by a compariſon of this caſe with the
like under the Law. To deſpiſe a Law is to oppoſe the being power, and
execution of the Law, that it may be void and of no force; or ſo to diſobey
it, that he may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. And he was ſaid to deſpiſe Moſes Law,
who did preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly violate any commandement of that Law; for which the
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death was ordained without mercy. And this was framed
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt them, who deſpiſed the firſt precept of the
Decalogue, and revolted to the worſhip of falſe gods. For the firſt
Commandement is the foundation of all the reſt, and he that deſpiſeth or
oppoſeth it, doth ſeeme thereby to overthrow the whole Law of God, and to
revolt from it. Hence we may gather, that among wilfull ſinners (as appeares
by their deſcription added in the verſe following) they hold the firſt
ranke, who revolt from Chriſt. For they who forſake Chriſt the Son of
God, do alſo forſake God himſelfe, and manifeſtly offend againſt the
fundamentall Law of the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Died without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, under
two or three witneſſes</hi>] <hi>i.</hi> muſt dye or be put to death; for
here is not conſidered what was done, but what by the Law of Moſes ought to
be done.</p>
               <p n="29">29. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye
ſhall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>] Here is the reddition of the former
compariſon; which as the words themſelves ſhew, was drawne from the
leſſe to the more. For it is a farre fowler offence to deſpiſe and
reject the Son of God, then Moſes, the Goſpel, then the Law. Wherefore if
to thoſe who wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended againſt Moſes and the Law, there was
granted no pardon, nor no place left for mercy; much leſſe muſt they hope
it, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Son of God; and much more are they to feare a more
heavy judgement. And therefore he can have no hope in the mercy of God, that is
found to be in ſo high an offence, and in ſo wicked a ſtate of life.
<hi>Who hath trodden under foote the Sonne of God</hi>] They tread the Sonne of
God under foote, firſt who are obſtinate enemies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; then
Apoſtates, who forſake the moſt holy Religion thereof, either in their
judgement and their profeſſion, or in their profeſſion onely: and after
thoſe, who in profeſſion adhere to the Son of God, but in their lives and
manners doe trample upon his holy ordinances and tread them under their feete.
And there is a great emphaſis in the word treading underfeet, for thereby is
ſignified the moſt high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Son of God, who is moſt worthy
of all honour; that the great wickedneſſe whereof ſuch wretches are
guilty, may appeare <pb n="234" facs="tcp:61860:121"/>more evidently. <hi>And hath counted
the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, and unholy
thing.</hi> He aggravates the wickednes of theſe men, eſpecially of
Apoſtats; who count the bloud of Chriſt, a vulgar and common thing, &amp;
therefore unholy and profane. For profane is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to holines,
eſpecially to ſuch holines which is in the bloud of the Sonne of God, who
being in his perſon moſt holy, his bloud alſo muſt needs be holy. Now
they profane the bloud of Chriſt, who either forſake Gods Covenant
conſecrated and hallowed by the bloud of Chriſt; or elſe eſteeme it not
of that value, as for his ſake whoſe bloud it was, to aboliſh their
ſins and afterward lead an holy life. <hi>Wherewith he was ſanctified;</hi>
Sactified here is not referred to Chriſt as he had beene ſanctified with
his owne blood, but to the wicked ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who by his Apoſtacy profanes
that blood wherewith he was once ſanctified. For the bloud of Chriſt is
ſo farre from being an unholy thing, that it is moſt holy, and ſo holy,
that thereby every man is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified or hallowed; yea, they themſelves
were thereby once ſanctified, who afterward through their foule
ungodlineſſe counted it unholy. And we are ſaid to be ſanctified by the
bloud of Chriſt, becauſe by it our ſinnes are expiated through faith in
Chriſt. For they who receive the faith of Chriſt, and ſo incorporated
into the new Covenant, they obtaine pardon of all their former ſinnes, by
vertue of the Covenant, and therefore alſo by vertue of that bloud wherewith
the Covenant was eſtabliſted. For an Impunitie, wherein the remiſſion
of ſins doth properly conſiſt, is here by attained in ſuch a manner,
that they have not onely a right to it by vertue of the Covenant, but doe
actually enjoy it, as long as they perſiſt in the faith, on condition their
faith be lively and working by love: becauſe ſo long God doth neither
really puniſh them, unleſſe it be by way of correction to further their
ſalvation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he any intention to puniſh or deſtroy them, but
rather ordains and orders them to eternall ſalvation, by removing all
obſtacles that may hinder it, if they be not wanting to themſelves. And all
this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the new Covenant, and the bloud of Chriſt, wherewith it is
confirmed and eſtabliſhed. And therefore no Chriſtian given to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
can have any hope from the bloud of Chriſt, as long as hee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not his
life and manners. For that is moſt true which the Apoſtle hath written;
<hi>If wee walke in the light as hee is in the light, wee have fellowſhip one
with another, and the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, cleanſeth us from
all ſinne,</hi> 1. John 1.7. Hence it appeares, that wee are ſanctified and
cleanſed by the bloud of Chriſt for the time to come, yet upon this
condition, if for the time to come, wee walke in the light as God is in the
light. <hi>i.</hi> If wee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bee like God in holineſſe and
righteouſneſſe, perſiſting therein conſtantly to our lives end. Yet
the word <hi>Sanctifying</hi> in this place, may ſignifie that ſeparation
of Chriſtians from other men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <pb n="235" facs="tcp:61860:121"/>through the
knowledge of Gods truth, they are ſequeſtred from the profane and common
ſort of men, and conſecrated for the ſervice of God. For by the bloud of
Chriſt, wherewith the new Covenant is eſtabliſhed, men are moved to
embrace Chriſtian religion, and receive it for the true. <hi>And hath done
deſpite unto the ſpirit of grace.</hi>] By the Spirit is underſtood that
holy Spirit powred into the faithfull, which is called the Spirit of grace,
becauſe it is given by the ſingular grace and goodnes of God. To this
Spirit he doth deſpite, whoſoever rejecteth the Religion of Chriſt; or
eſteemes it not ſo much as therefore to live holily, according to the
direction and ſuggeſtion of that Spirit: For he gives not that credit to it
that he ought, and beſides he doth in a manner as much, as if he accounted it
falſe.</p>
               <p n="30">30. <hi>For we know him that hath ſaid, Vengeace
belongeth unto me.</hi>] He confimes here, what he ſaid before of their
fearfull puniſhments, who wilfully runne into theſe ſinnes. Aud for this
purpoſe hee citeth here the words of God, Deut. 32.35. wherein God
challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe recompence, vengeance and judgement: or
profeſſeth of himſelfe that he will execute it. Although God ſpeake it
there of vindicating his owne people, and puniſhing thoſe that
oppreſſed them: but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here applies them to that puniſhment,
which God himſelf will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon his owne people, if they rebell
againſt God and Chriſt. The meaning is, that God will lay a heavy vengeance
and judgement upon thoſe that are rebellious and obſtinate againſt the
Sonne of God. For we all know how great, how powerfull and how terrible he is,
that hath reſerved recompence and vengeance to himſelfe. Yet in theſe
words, <hi>Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will recompence.</hi>] The intent
is not ſo much to ſhew who the perſon is that hath this right to take
vengeance; as to leave it to our conſideration, how great and potent the
perſon is, who challengeth the execution of it to himſelfe: that hence it
may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how grievous and how certaine the puniſhment of the wicked
ſhall be. <hi>Saith the Lord,</hi>] Here the perſon is expreſſed, who
challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to himſelfe the execution of vengeance, yet not ſo much for
the deſigning of his perſon, as for the notifying of his power, that he is
the Lord Jehovah, the moſt high, onely and Almighty God, maker of heaven and
earth. <hi>And againe, the Lord ſhall judge his people.</hi>] Againe, is in
the ſame place, which was cited before. And in the word <hi>Lord,</hi> lies
the Emphaſis and force of the argument. For if the Lord himſelf who is the
moſt high God, ſhall judge his people; who ſees not but that the
judgement muſt needs be moſt heavy and fearfull? To judge here,
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to condemne and puniſh. In Deuteronomie (as we ſaid) is
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe words, that the Lord would avenge his people upon their
enemies from the oppreſſions and wrongs done to his people. But the Author
following the more frequent uſe and ſenſe of thoſe words in other
paſſages of the Scriptures, hath applyed them to the puniſhment 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61860:122"/>of Gods people falling from their faith and obedience,
For it is no leſſe true, that the Lord will puniſh his owne people if
they bee refractory and rebellious againſt him, then that he would judge and
avenge their cauſe, and vindicate them from injuries, if they were wrongfully
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And the words <hi>his people,</hi> doe alſo argue the
fearfulneſſe of the judgement. For it is great reaſon, that the people of
God, if they ſhall preſume to be rebellious and obſtinate againſt God,
ſhould ſuffer a heavier puniſhment then other men. And they are here
called the people of God, who are diſobedient and obſtinate, becauſe they
have received the knowledge of God, and of his truth; and in that reſpect
ſtand obliged to God in a peculiar manner. Beſides the appellations or
names of things do often remaine, when the true ground or cauſe of the name
is altered and gone.</p>
               <p n="31">31. <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of
the living God</hi>] This is as it were the major Propoſition of the Authors
Argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would make it appeare, that the puniſhment of the
perſons fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned will be very grievous and fearfull. For he reaſoneth
thus, To fall into the hands of the living God is a fearfull thing: but theſe
men fall into the hands of the living God, ſeeing (as we have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready)
God himſelfe will doe judgement and execution upon them: And therefore their
puniſhment muſt needs be fearfull. But hee puts the concluſion in the
firſt place, then the aſſumption, and now he addes the major
propoſition, which is of a knowne verity. For what man is he, that will not
acknowledge, how fearfull a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living
God? becauſe the living God can puniſh far more fearfully then mortall men
can doe. Why God is called living, wee have ſhewed before Chap. 9.14. But we
muſt note, that the Author ſpeaks here of that puniſhment, whereby God
puts men to everlaſting deſtruction, and doth it in his wrath, and not of
that chaſtiſement which God ſometime inflicts for the good of his people.
For it is farre better to be chaſtiſed and corrected from God himſelfe,
and from his owne hand, then to be left to the pleaſure of wicked men; as
David te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, 2 Sam. 24.14.</p>
               <p n="32">32. <hi>But call to remembrance the former dayes</hi>]
Hee brings here a new argument, whereby he perſwades the Hebrewes to
conſtancie and perſeverance in the Chriſtian Religion; and he drawes it
from their former conſtancie and vertue, which they ſhewed at the beginning
when firſt they received the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>In which after ye were
il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated</hi>] Chriſt is ſeverall times called the light and the true
light, becauſe he brought into the world by the publiſhing of the Goſpel
that knowledge of God which doth truly illuminate and enlighten us; not only in
reſpect of that naturall ignorance that growes up with men concerning God,
but in reſpect of that revealed knowledge which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Covenant
was but darke and ſhady; for the Goſpell doth <pb n="237" facs="tcp:61860:122"/>reveale
unto us thoſe myſteries which did before lye hid: for ſince the vaile of
the old Sanctuary was rent, we now have liberty to looke into the heavenly
Sanctuary, where by faith wee ſee and know many myſteries, eſpecially
touching the expiation of our ſinnes, and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſoules. Of
which truth, when we receive the knowledge, we are ſaid to be illuminated.
And this illumination is the firſt act of our entrance into Covenant with
God; for thereby it is, that we are made acquainted with the ſacred contents
of the Covenant. So that <hi>Illuminated</hi> here is all one with
<hi>receiving the knowledge of the truth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ver. 26. <hi>Yee
endured a great fight of afflictions</hi>] To endure afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Chriſt,
and not decline them, but patiently and ſtoutly to goe through the triall of
them, is a great conflict or fight.</p>
               <p n="33">33. <hi>Partly while ye were made a gazing ſtocke both
by reproaches and afflections</hi>] Reproaches and afflictions, are put for all
ſorts of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof theſe two are the chiefe kindes; for
reproaches are thoſe perſecutions whereby a mans reputation, credit, or
good name is vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and afflictions are thoſe whereby men ſuffer in their
bodies and goods, as by ſines, impriſonments, and puniſhments. And
reproaches and afflictions are the means whereby Gods people are made a gazing
ſtocke, or a ſpectacle for men to looke at. Yet it is not neceſſary wee
ſhould take this word properly, as if the Hebrews had been condemned by
publicke decree of the Magiſtrate, and in the ſight of all men brought upon
a Scaffold, there to ſuffer puniſhment, or to be branded with reproaches;
which notwithſtanding did many times befall the Chriſtians: But it may be
taken metaphorically, for thoſe reproaches and afflictions in generall, which
were publickly known to all, or were in a manner in all mens mouths; as for
example, when a Chriſtian was openly reviled, or beaten, or dragged through
the ſtreets, or had his houſe by publicke authority, and open force
plundered and rifled. <hi>And partly when ye became companions of them that
were ſo uſed</hi>] This is done, when we take care and make proviſion for
them who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and afflicted; when wee harbour them, helpe and
cheriſh them, make their caſe our owne, and profeſſe our ſelves their
brethren and companions. Men are uſed to reproaches and afflictions, when
they many times and often ſuffer them, and by reaſon of them are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
vexed, and toſſed too and fro, from place to place; for ſo much is here
ſignified by the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="34">34. <hi>For ye had compaſsion of me in my bonds, and
tooke joyfully the ſpoyling of your goods</hi>] Here he declares both thoſe
particulars which in the verſe going before he had expreſſed and
attributed to them; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he puts the latter in the firſt place, and
the former in the latter. For the compaſſion they had, belong to their
accompanying of thoſe who were reproached and afflicted; becauſe true
compaſſion (as in this place is meant) ſignifies not a bare griefe of
minde proceeding <pb n="238" facs="tcp:61860:123"/>from anothers miſery, but therewithall
includes the effects and deeds of a minde truly compaſſionate; And the
ſpoiling of their goods, is referred to the reproches and afflictions which
they ſuffered. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your ſelves that ye have in heaven a better
and an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>] He expreſſeth the cauſe why they
tooke the ſpoiling of their goods joyfully, namely, becauſe they had
learned from the Religion of Chriſt, and thereby knew for certaine, that a
farre better eſtate, and more laſting poſſeſſions, yea
everlaſting, were reſerved for them in heaven; for which theſe earthly
and tranſitory goods are very gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exchanged, eſpecially when they
are made away for Chriſts ſake. And the place where this excellent and
everlaſting eſtate is reſerved is in <hi>Heaven;</hi> which doth further
argue the excellency and eternity of it; for though Chriſtians are
ſometimes ſpoiled of their goods which they have upon earth, yet of thoſe
they have in heaven they neither ſhall nor can ever be ſpoiled. For that in
heaven can be no ſpoile, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by moth, ruſt, nor thiefe, Chriſt
teacheth us. Mat. 6.20. <hi>Lay up for your ſelves treaſures in heaven
where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where theeves doe not breake
through nor ſteale.</hi> And this everlaſting eſtate, though it be in
heaven, yet the faithfull even while they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth have it already,
though not for the poſſeſſion of it, for fleſh and bloud cannot
poſſeſſe it: but for the expectation of it, by faith and hope as
ſonnes and heires unto it; for now they have the ſame right that the heire
under age hath to his inheritance, whereby they know, beleeve and hope with
full aſſurance that they ſhall poſſeſſe it.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>Caſt not away therefore your confidence</hi>]
From the words prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he inferres an exhortation, that ſeeing they have
gotten ſuch a good report for their courage and conſtancy, therefore they
ſhould not now be overcome with miſeries and diſtreſſes, and ſo
turne from the right courſe of godlineſſe whereinto they were now
entered. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence here he meanes either an undaunted courage of
conſtancy of minde in profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion; or elſe a
full truſt in God, whereby we ſo rely upon him, and are ſo certaine of
our heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, that we refuſe the ſuffering of no evill.
<hi>Which hath great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward</hi>] He brings a motive whereby to
perſwade his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exhortation, that they ſhould not caſtaway their
confidence; namely becauſe their confidence ſhould have a great recompence
of reward; and therefore it muſt not be idle and vaine, leaſt it ſhould
loſe the reward; for to idleneſſe and vanity no reward can in equity be
due: but their confidence muſt be effectuall and painefull in the exerciſes
of holineſſe and good works, that thereby they hold and keepe their title
to the reward. For though faith and not good workes do create as the title
whereby wee have the reward: yet good workes doe preſerve or maintaine that
title which was created by faith, and by good works we hold our right to the
reward; and without them wee ſhall certainly <pb n="239" facs="tcp:61860:123"/>loſe the
reward. And beſides theſe words have reference to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe
wherein he ſhewed, what this recompence of reward is; namely an excellent and
enduring ſubſtance in heaven.</p>
               <p n="36">36. <hi>For ye have need of patience</hi>] Here is
another motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the former exhortation, why they ſhould not
caſt away their confidence, but be patient under reproaches and afflictions,
even to the ſpoyling of their goods; namely, becauſe they have need of
patience. Which may be taken in a double ſence; either with a check, as if
they wanted patience; or without a check; for to have need of a thing doth
ſometime imply a ſimple neceſſity of that thing whereby to attaine
ſomewhat, whether we have that thing or have it not; ſometime it implies a
neceſſity joyned with the want of that thing. <hi>That after ye have done
the will of God, ye might receiue the promiſe</hi>] Hee expreſſeth the
uſe and end of patience, that he might ſhew, to what purpoſe they have
need of it. And the uſe of patience is two fold; the one more neere, the
other more remote; which in reſpect of us is the laſt. The neerer or former
uſe of our patience is, To do the will of God; ſeeing patience it ſelfe
is not the leaſt part of Gods will, and without it the other parts of
godlineſſe, and conſequently the reſt of Gods will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not throughly be
performed. The other uſe and laſt end of patience, which followes from the
former, and without which this cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, is to receive the
promiſe, or rather the matter promiſed; which is the inheritance of the
ever-enduring ſubſtance. For they onely do at laſt receive the promiſe
of God who firſt performe the will of God. Wherefore without patience and
conſtancy in ſuffering evils, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as to performe the
will of God, ſo to receive the ever-endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſubſtance which is the
promiſe of God.</p>
               <p n="37">37. <hi>For yet a little while</hi>] Another motive to
ſtirre them up to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuffering, urged by way of preventing an
objection. Some man might ſay; It is an hard caſe, for a man to lye under
afflictions ſo long a time, and to expect the promiſe whereof you ſpeake
after many ages. To this the Author anſwers, that the time allotted for our
patience, is not long, but ſhort; for after a little while, we ſhall
receive the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or reward of our patience promiſed unto us; and
ſeeing this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe though it be delayed, yet the delay is but for a
little while, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the delay of it ſhould diſcourage no man, or
diſhearten him under afflictions. <hi>And he that ſhall come will come and
will not tarry</hi>] The time remaining for the comming of Chriſt is but a
little while, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certaine; for very certaine it is, becauſe he ſhall
and will come; and but a little while, becauſe he will not tarry. The reward
promiſed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be farre off, and therefore wee muſt not be wearied with
the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and ſtay of it: for there is but a little while yet
remaining for the comming of Chriſt; and at his comming is the comming of the
promiſed reward; for he will bring the reward with him, and they 
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61860:124"/>ſhall receive it, who have done the will of God. That
the time to the comming of Chriſt is but a little while, is gathered from
hence, becauſe that the time of each mans life is but a little while; &amp;
at the end of each mans life is the comming of Chriſt to him, as we have
ſhewed before, verſe 25. Hence Paul ſaith, That the burden of our
afflictions is but light, and the time but for a moment, compared with the
eternitie of that glory which ſhall follow upon it. 2. Cor. 4.17. And Peter
to abate the force of our temptations and afflictions ſaith, That wee are now
for a ſeaſon in heavines through manifold temptations. 1. Pet. 1.6. And hee
ſaith againe, That after wee have ſuffered a while, the God of all grace,
will exalt us by Chriſt into his eternall glory. 1. Pet. 5.10. Yet when the
Author ſaith, yet a little while, he tacitely grants, that there ſhall be
ſome ſpace of time intervening; as appeareth by the words of the Prophet,
to whom herein hee hath reference. For the Prophet ſaith, If it tarry, wait
for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry. Hab. 2.3. Some
tarrying therefore there will be, yet ſhort and ſmall; and therefore wee
ought to expect it without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe.</p>
               <p n="38">38. <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>] The
Authour proceeds in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging further words of the Prophet; wherein is
contained a new motive to conſtancy in faith, on which our patience and
ſufferings of evils depends. For from theſe words it appears, what great
fruit grows from an invincible faith, that will not be beaten downe by any
afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and on the contrary what great miſchiefe followes upon a minde
born down with afflictions, and falling from the faith. Now the fruit of faith
is life; even everlaſting life: For the juſt ſhall live by his faith.
<hi>i.</hi> He therefore ſhall live, becauſe he wholly truſteth upon God,
and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his goodneſſe, power, wiſedome, and promiſes, do
never let fall their courage, what ever difficulties and impediments they meet
withall in their obedience to Gods precepts; hee is not dejected with any
ſtorme of evils; hee is not wearied with any waiting for the ſtay of the
promiſed reward; and therefore hee perſeveres in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to
his laſt end. For faith in this place is conſidered, as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with patience, conſtancie, pietie and juſtice, and as it is a living and a
lively faith that is exerciſed and delighted in good workes. For life is not
promiſed to every man upon faith, but to the juſt and righteous man; and to
this faith is oppoſed <hi>drawing backe</hi> in the words following. <hi>But
if any man draw backe</hi>] To draw backe from God, is nothing elſe, but in
deſpaire of his promiſes to ceaſe from our duetie; and to depart from the
hard conflict of patience, juſtice, and pietie; and in a word to acquit the
Chriſtian warfare, and ſteale from the Armie of Chriſt. <hi>My ſoul
ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>] Thus the Septuagint have tranſlated
the Hebrew text, of the ſoule of God, and not of his ſoule who drawes back,
of whom the <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61860:124"/>Hebrew text may be underſtood. For in that
it is, his ſoul is not right in him. If therefore according to the Hebrew
text, the words bee taken of his ſoule who drawes backe, then the meaning is,
the ſoule of that man is not right in him, his ſoule hath not a ſincere
and true love to vertue; becauſe his ſoule being weary of vertue and good
workes takes thence an occaſion to doubt of Gods promiſes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch a ſoule is not right, but perverſe, therefore it pleaſeth not God.
Wherefore ſeeing the juſt who lives by his faith, is oppoſed to the man
that drawes backe, and the juſt mans condition to this mans condition,
therefore the adverſative particle <hi>but,</hi> is by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour rightly
applyed, even to this latter clauſe; but in the Prophet the clauſes are
tranſpoſed, and this latter put in the former place, <hi>vid.</hi> Hab.
2.4.</p>
               <p n="39">39. <hi>But we are not of them who draw backe unto
perdition.</hi>] Having declared the condition of the juſt man, who is
conſtant in his faith; and of the man who drawes backe, or wavers in his
faith and pietie, hee now ſhewes that not this latter, but that former muſt
be the condition of Chriſtians, whoſe ſtate doth require from them that
they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the faith, that by this meanes they may ſave their
ſoules, and not waver in faith, to withdraw themſelves from the conflicts
of pietie and patience, and ſo bring perdition to their ſoules. For the
Authour ſpeakes not of what actually is done, but what in juſtice ought to
bee done, and is agreeing to the calling and condition of a Chriſtian. The
ſame ſentence in a manner is contained in thoſe words of the Apoſtle,
where deſcribing the condition of Chriſtians, hee ſaith, <hi>God hath not
appointed us to wrath, but to obtaine ſalvation,</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.9. Now the
end of drawing backe is perdition or deſtruction; as the iſſue of faith
is the ſaving of the ſoule; for perdition and ſalvation are oppoſed.
<hi>But of them that beleeve to the ſaving of the ſoule.</hi> The ſoule
in this place doth either ſignifie onely our life, or our ſpirit, which is
the principall part of us; and being preſerved for us, and reſtored unto
us, Our life remanes in ſafetie. And we ſave our life or ſpirit, when we
are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from deſtruction, unto ſuch a life that can never be
deſtroyed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow faith is the ſubſtance of things
hoped</hi>] The Author having in the former Chapter ſpoken of faith, doth
thence take occaſion to make a digreſſion in this Chapter, for a further
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the nature of faith; whereof hee collecteth and produceth many
examples in divers holy perſons, that the Hebrews inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their examples,
might addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for imitation of them, and finally relying on
Gods promiſes, might not decline any conflict either of piety or patience.
Theſe words are not a definition of Faith whereby faith is defined; as
thoſe words afterward, Chap. 12.29. where God is ſaid to be a conſuming
fire, are not the definition of God. For faith is a thing indefinite, and
cannot be defined; or if it were definable, yet theſe words, that it is the
ſubſtance of things hoped, are far too narrow to lay out the true
boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of Faith. Neither are theſe words an attribute of faith, for they
are not conſequent to follow upon it; but quite contrary. Faith is an
attribute or conſequent to them. For they are a notion, an element, or an
argument of faith, whereby faith may be notified or made knowne, and whereby it
may be demonſtrated or proved to be in ſuch or ſuch a ſubject, or in
ſuch a perſon. For though the vulgar affirmation be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the
Author, that Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped; yet the true naturall
and rationall affirmation runnes thus: Now the ſubſtance of things hoped,
is faith. For the ſcope of the Author is to produce many perſons whom he
would declare and demonſtrate to have been faithfull; and for that purpoſe
he layes out two notions or principles of faith, whereby he would inferre and
conclude the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith to bee in ſuch or ſuch a ſubject; the
firſt whereof is this, That every ſubſtance of things hoped, is faith; as
if he had ſaid, where things hoped are ſubſiſtent, there is faith;
where things to come are <pb n="244" facs="tcp:61860:128"/>preſent, there is faith. Now
things hoped, and things to come, are not actually ſubſiſtent and
preſent: but when the ſoule apprehends things hoped and to come, as
certainly as if they were already ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent and preſent, then that
ſoule beleeves, and is endued with faith. And this principle or argument of
faith, is taken from a partiall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith, which is of ſome good to
come, becauſe hope ariſeth only from ſuch an object. <hi>The evidence of
things not ſeen</hi>] This is the other principle or notion, or argument of
faith, whereto faith is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſequent. For where there is an evidence
of things inevident, or a ſight of things unſeen, there is faith. And for
evidence ſome Tranſlations render it argument; becauſe where there is an
argument perſwading a man for things not ſeen, there is faith. And this
principle of faith is taken from the totall object of faith, which is alwayes
of things not ſeen, or abſent, whether it be for diſtance of place, or of
time, either paſt or to come. And therefore this principle muſt needs be
more large then the former, and more ſerviceable to inferre the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of
faith to be demonſtrable of more perſons, as the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of
it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For by it the elders obtained a good report</hi>]
The two former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or notions that argue and inferre faith, had alſo
a further end, which is to ſhew the excellency of faith: which here he
confirmes by the effect which faith wrought unto the Elders their forefathers.
For to them their faith brought this benefit, that by it they obtained a good
report. The originall is, by it they had a teſtimony, which is well
tranſlated a good report; for ſo the word doth frequently ſignifie,
though it ſtand ſingle and alone without any other attribute joyned to it,
ſee Act. 6.3. and Act. 10.22. and Act. 16.2. and Act. 22.12. This teſtimony
or good report the Elders obtained from the Scripture, or of God by the
relation of Scripture, which hath left it upon holy record, how graciouſly
God dealt with thoſe elders by reaſon of their faith, how greatly he
favoured them for it, and commended their piety iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it. <hi>The
elders.</hi>] <hi>i.</hi> Their progenitours and anceſtours, whom the
Scripture mentions to have lived from the beginning of the world downe to that
age wherein this Author lived.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By faith we underſtand</hi>] Hee begins here to
ſhew the efficacie and vertue of faith, by certaine examples or inſtances,
which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates from the latter principle or argument of faith, in
that every evidence or ſight of things unſeen is faith. For all men that
ever had, or ever ſhall have faith in God, doe thereby underſtand that God
fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the world by his word; and becauſe we underſtand this by an
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or ſight of things unſeen, therefore we underſtand it by faith.
<hi>We underſtand</hi>] <hi>i.</hi> We perceive and know for certaine; and
the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or mean whereby we know this, is our faith; and the argument or
mean whereby our faith attaines this knowledge; is our evidence or 
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61860:128"/>ſight of things unſeen; for by the things which are
now ſeen, wee have a ſight of thoſe things which we never ſaw,
becauſe they were done long before our times. Though it may be evinced by
ſtrong arguments that the world was created; yet neither thoſe arguments
and the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of them, are obvious to all men; neither are they ſuch, but
that a perverſe ſpirit will oppoſe againſt them; becauſe we ſaw not
the work of the Creation: but by the Scriptures we have an evidence or ſight
of that Creation, which to us was unſeen; and therefore we beleeve it, for
our evidence or ſight of it in the Scriptures makes faith of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. And
the Scriptures make faith unto us of the Creation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the act of it,
that ſuch a worke was done, but for the manner how it was done (as Moſes
deſcribes it) even by the word, and ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; and for the
matter whereof it was made, in that the things ſeene, were made of things not
ſeene. <hi>That the worlds were framed</hi>] Worlds, for world, the number
plurall for the ſingular, by a Greciſme, where originally it is ages,
putting the adjuncts of the world for the ſubject. <hi>By the word of
God</hi>] by the only <hi>fiat</hi> or command of God; God uſed no other
inſtrument for the framing of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his bare word. For God
only <hi>ſaid the word, Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Gen.
1.3. And <hi>by the word of the Lord, even by the breath of his mouth, were the
heavens made and all the hoſt of them,</hi> Pſal. 33.6. And as the heavens,
ſo alſo the earth was framed and ſetled by his word; <hi>For he ſpake
and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt,</hi> Pſal. 33.9. <hi>So
that things which are ſeen were not made of things which do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi> The
particle <hi>not</hi> ſeems to be tranſpoſed, for it ſhould affect the
word appeare, becauſe the minde and ſenſe of this clauſe is not
nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but affirmative, thus: So that things which are ſeen were made of
things which doe not appeare, though for the matter it come all to one;
becauſe a terme finite denyed of any ſubject is all one with the ſame
terme infinited and affirmed; yet this latter expreſſion leaves in our
mindes a cleare apprehenſion of the matter. The Author ſeems as his manner
is, to follow and reflect upon the Greek Tranſlation of the Old Teſtament,
wherein at the beginning of Geneſis, it is ſaid, that the Earth was
inviſible, for that which we from the Hebrew tranſlate, that the <hi>Earth
was without forme and void.</hi> And the Author made choice rather to ſay,
<hi>things not appearing,</hi> then things inviſible, when he would ſhew us
the prime materialls whereof the world was made: For that is properly
inviſible, which naturally cannot be perceived by the ſight; and that is
rightly tearmed not appearing, which though it be naturally viſible, yet
really it appears not; eſpecially then when it lyes hidden and covered with
thicke darkneſſe. Although in this place the word <hi>not-appearing</hi>
ſeems to have yet a more ample ſenſe, and to compriſe that want of
forme and force noted by the Hebrew words, for which the Greek Tranſlation
reads inviſible. Wherefore by things <pb n="246" facs="tcp:61860:129"/>not appearing is
meant that chaos or elements of the world, which at the beginning were
confuſed; becauſe partly that chaos wanted forme, ſhape, and outward
beauty, in regard the ſeverall parts of it were not yet digeſted and
diſpoſed into that elegant order, figure, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which afterward
was given it by the Creation; and therefore the Scripture ſaith, it was
without <hi>forme;</hi> and partly becauſe it wanted ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and force to
produce thoſe creatures, and adorne it ſelfe, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God by the
Creation gave it power to produce; but to any ſuch purpoſe it was wholly
feeble and barren; and therefore the Scripture ſaith it was <hi>void;</hi>
and partly againe becauſe it wanted light to manifeſt and make it viſible
to the ſight that it might be ſeene; for though in it ſelfe it were
viſible and appearable; yet actually it appeared not, and therefore the
Scripture ſaith, that darkeneſſe was upon the face of it. Wherefore when
God entered upon the worke of the world, the firſt perfect creature that he
made was the light, and that being finiſhed, he framed all the other parts of
the world in a moſt beautifull order. And this chaos is in the Scripture
called the <hi>Deepe,</hi> becauſe it was vaſt both for quantity and
quality, for it wanted the three beautifull quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of forme, force and
light, which afterward were induced into it. Yet ſometimes the Scriptures
expreſſe it by names Synecdochicall, which ſignifie onely a part of it,
calling it ſometime the heaven, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the earth, and ſometime the
waters, becauſe it was a Deepe or chaos compoſed and confuſed of all
theſe together, or at leaſt of thoſe materials whereof all theſe were
afterward produced and created; as in the ſame tub of milke there lye
confuſed together thoſe three mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials from which are afterward produced
the diſtinct white meates of butter, cheeſe, and whey. Hereby the Author
plainely declares, and it ſufficiently alſo appeares from the hiſtory of
the Creation deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Moſes, that God, when he began the Creation or
frame of the world, as it is delivered in the beginning of Geneſis, did not
produce it meerely from nothing, but from that Chaos or Deepe, which
poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively was confuſed of the three materials, whereof afterward was made
the three elements of heaven, earth and water; and privitively wanted the three
qualities of forme, force and light. And this opinion was anciently received
among the people of God, as it appeares by the Author of the booke of
Wiſdome, chap. 11.17. where ſpeaking to God, he ſaith, For thy almighty
hand, that made the world of matter without forme; for ſo it is in the Greek;
and the vulgar Latin hath it, of matter unſeene. But of the creation of this
matter, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the Scriptures; for to the holy Ghoſt it
ſeemed good to conceale it. By <hi>things which are ſeene,</hi> are here
meant all thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which we ſee in this world, as this beautifull
order and poſture of all things, whereby thoſe things which before were
confuſed and blended together, are now digeſted into their ſeverall ranks
and places <pb n="247" facs="tcp:61860:129"/>for the uſe and benefit of man and beaſt;
and all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both animate and inanimate, both in
heaven, earth, and waters, were produced by the word or command of God. For in
theſe words of the Author is ſignified, not onely that change whereby
things not appearing became appearing, by vertue of that light which God made,
and made to ſhine upon them, (which change God made firſt of all by his
creation of light) but alſo that change, whereby the things which now
appeare, were made of things not-appearing, as from the informed matter of the
Chaos or Deepe, which wanting forme, force, and light, was ſo rude, ſo
weake and ſo darke, that from it ſelfe, of it ſelfe, nothing would ever
have beene produced, but by the acceſſe of Gods almighty power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent
ſacrifice then Cain</hi>] Now he begins to reckon up ſpeciall and
particular examples of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons endued with faith; and withall he declares
both what they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by vertue of their faith, and alſo what
bleſſings they obtained from God by it: that by ſo many illuſtrious
examples he might winne the Hebrewes to an imitation of thoſe perſons.
Firſt of all he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Abel, as a perſon neerely approaching to the
beginning of the world. He mentions not our firſt Parents; either becauſe
concerning them there is nothing read memorable in the Canonicall books of the
Old Teſtament, pertinent to his purpoſe; or becauſe he thought them not
to be mentioned, by reaſon of that ſinne whereby they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their poſterity ſubject unto death; eſpecially ſeeing in thoſe
Canonicall bookes we no where reade that God ever pardoned our firſt Parents
for their ſinne; although the Author of the booke of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the
beginning of the tenth chapter affirmes, <hi>That Wiſdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the
firſt formed father of the world, that was created alone, and brought him out
of his fall;</hi> that is, ſhe freed him from the guilt and puniſhment of
his ſinne. Therefore he begins with Abel their ſon, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him in the
firſt place as the firſt perſon among thoſe whoſe piety towards God,
and Gods love toward them is celebrated in Scripture, and then ſhews what
Abel obtained by his faith. Of him therefore he ſaith, That <hi>he offered a
more excellent ſacrifice then Cain</hi>] Some render it a more bountifull
ſacrifice, others a more valuable; thinking the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor intended to note,
that Cain as an ungratefull and a diſtruſtfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, offered onely a
few fruits: but Abel to teſtifie his affection and faith offered things of
more value, namely the firſtlings and fatteſt of his ſheepe. But the more
ſimple and certaine meaning is, that Abels ſacrifice was not more
bountifull or more valuable of it ſelfe then the others, but more acceptable
unto God, who accepted and eſteemed it better and more excellent, by reaſon
of the righteouſneſſe and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the perſon that offered
it; for upon that ground it is that God eſteemes and values all offerings
made unto him. Now there was no <pb n="248" facs="tcp:61860:130"/>other cauſe of that
godlineſſe, and conſequently of Gods acceptation of Abels ſacrifice,
but onely Abels ſaith, whereby he ſtood perſwaded, that God was, and was
a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeeke him, and ſue to him for his favour by
godlineſſe and righteouſneſſe. And there was no other cauſe of his
faith, but that he had in him, the ſubſtance of things hoped for; for his
hope of Gods favour and of Gods reward, did breed this faith of God in him.
Furthermore he whoſe offering God hath in eſteeme, his perſon muſt
needs be in more eſteeme with God; for from this roote growes the true
happineſſe of every man. But that Cain offered the fruits of the earth, and
Abel the firſtlings of his cattell, the reaſon was becauſe Cain was an
husbandman, and Abel an heards-man: So both of them offered their ſacrifice
to God, out of that ſubſtance wherein each abounded. And that the word
ſacrifice which properly ſignifies an offering from the Herd which is
ſlaine, ſhould be tacitly referred to Cains offering, which was onely of
fruits; this muſt be attributed to the runne of the compariſon, the fitting
whereof doth many times make way to ſome abuſions or improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>By
which he obtained witneſſe that he was righteous.</hi> The words <hi>by
which</hi> are better referred to Abels faith, then to his ſacrifice; for the
following words <hi>and by it he being dead, yet ſpeaketh,</hi> are in like
manner referred to his faith, for they expreſſe a peculiar fruit of it. But
where did Abel obtaine this teſtimony of his righteouſneſſe? even in
that paſſage of Scripture where God had reſpect to him and to his
ſacrifice, but not to that which Cain offered: as we reade it, Gen. 4.4,5. or
as the Author declares himſelfe in the words following, <hi>God teſtifying
of his gifts</hi>] For therein God teſtified of his gifts or offerings, that
they were acceptable unto him, in that he had reſpect unto them. And very
probable it is, that God ſhewed his teſtimony and acceptance thereof, by
ſome fire ſent from heaven, which conſumed the ſacrifice and offering
of Abel. And when God doth accept of a mans gifts and offerings being
graciouſly pleaſed to receive them; he doth thereby teſtifie and
witneſſe that man to be a righteous perſon; ſeeing no gifts or
offerings are acceptable to God, but ſuch as come from a righteous man: for
the ſacrifice of fooles or ſinners is an abomination to him. And when God
in his diſcourſe with Cain, rendred him a reaſon, why he had no reſpect
to his offering, he ſhewed cleerely enough, that both Cain did not well, and
that Abel did well, which is to be juſt, See Gen. 4.7. <hi>And by it be being
dead, yet ſpeaketh</hi>] Another fruit of Abels faith; which was the cauſe
that God would be an avenger of his innocent bloud, to perſecute and baniſh
from his preſence his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that had murdered him. Abels bloud is ſaid
to ſpeake or cry unto God by way of metaphor, becauſe God thereby is
vehemently incited and moved to take vengeance for the murder of a perſon
that was righteous and acceptable to God, as if his bloud had cried and ſued
to <pb n="249" facs="tcp:61860:130"/>God for juſtice to be done upon the murtherer. So in
the Revelation, the ſouls of them that were ſlaine for the word of God, are
ſaid to cry with a loud voice, <hi>How long O Lord, holy and true, doſt
thou not judge and avenge our bloud on them that dwell on the earth.</hi>
Revel. 6.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>By faith Enoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould
not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him.</hi>]
In the ſecond place, hee brings the Example of Enoch, and ſheweth what he
obtained by his faith. Into what place Enoch was tranſlated, the Scripture
expreſſeth not: but from what the Authour addes, <hi>that he ſhould not
ſee death,</hi> it appeares, hee was tranſlated into ſuch a place,
wherein men ſee not death. <hi>i.</hi> Are exempt and free from dying; which
ſeemes to be no other, or at leaſt no other knowne to us, then that
heavenly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of Immortalitie, wherein God, and Chriſt, and the holy
Angels dwell. But becauſe the Scripture expreſly ſaith not, that Enoch
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this favour by his faith; therefore the Authour proves it, by
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; <hi>For before his tranſlation he had this teſtimony, that he
pleaſed God</hi>] The reaſon may runne thus. Enoch was tranſlated,
becauſe he pleaſed God (which the thing it ſelfe ſhewes, and the
Scripture teſtifies that before his tranſlation he pleaſed God.) But
without faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God; therefore Enoch was
tranſlated by his faith. The conſequence of this argument ſhal be
defended afterward. Or rather the reaſon may thus be gathered, Enoch was
tranſlated, becauſe he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God; and becauſe he pleaſed God,
therefore hee had Gods teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of it; And againe, becauſe hee
pleaſed God, therefore hee had in himſelfe ſome ſubſtance of things
hoped for, and ſome evidence of things not ſeene; and becauſe hee had in
him this ſubſtance and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things hoped for and not ſeene,
therefore hee had faith; and becauſe he had faith, therefore by his faith,
hee was tranſlated. For in affirmative arguments, that which is firſt in
nature, is laſt in courſe of reaſon. <hi>He had this teſtimony;</hi>
namely, either from the holy Scripture, or from the holy Ghoſt, by whom the
Scripture was indited. But the giving or the taking of this teſtimony muſt
not be joyned with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding words, <hi>before his tranſlation,</hi> as
if this teſtimonie were made of him before he was tranſlated; but muſt be
only referred to the matter of the teſtimony, which is this, that before his
tranſlation he pleaſed God; and after his tranſlation, the Scripture
teſtified, that hee pleaſed God before it. And Enochs pleaſing of God,
may be underſtood two wayes; either that hee pleaſed God in endeavour, by
ſtudying and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to pleaſe him: or that hee pleaſed him in effect,
by an actuall ſervice of God, which latter is conſequent to the former. And
the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of this is given in Scripture, where it is ſaid, that
<hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi> Gen. 5.22.24. For hee that walketh with God,
certainely he endeavours to pleaſe God, and either in effect doth actually
pleaſe God, or at leaſt God is pleaſed with his endeavour. So likewiſe
of <pb n="250" facs="tcp:61860:131"/>Noah it is ſaid, That <hi>he was a juſt man, and
perfect in his generations, and that he walked with God.</hi> Gen. 6.9. For
this walking with God, which in the following verſe, the Authour
expreſſeth, by comming to God, and by ſeeking of God, doth ſignifie a
converſation of man with God, whereby in a manner hee doth alwayes reverence
God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes in his preſence, and (as I may ſay) never departing
out of his ſight, but having ever his minde and thoughts fixed upon him, and
is ſo addicted to Gods Lawes and Commands, that in all his actions through
the whole courſe of his life, hee hath God for his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and companion,
whom he follows and accompanies. Hee that is ſuch a man, muſt needs
endeavour to pleaſe God, and cannot chuſe but actually pleaſe him. For
the Greeke tranſlation, which (as hath beene often noted) the Authour
followes, doth render the Hebrew words of Enochs <hi>walking with God,</hi> by
Greeke words which properly ſignifie his pleaſing of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But without faith, it is impoſsible to pleaſe
God.</hi>] Now we come to the defence of that argument, which formerly we
mentioned; for here the Authour expreſly confirmes, and proves it by the
following words, <hi>For he that commeth to God, muſt beleeve that hee is,
and that hee is a rewarder of them, that diligently ſeek him.</hi>] Hee
proves I ſay, what before he had affirmed, by this explication of faith, or
rather by two ſpecifications of it: whereof the firſt is, to beleeve the
exiſtence of God, that God is; and the ſecond, to beleeve the
righteouſneſſe or equitie of God, that hee is a rewarder of them that
diligently ſeek him. For is it not wholly neceſſary, that he who commeth
to God, <hi>i.</hi> He who doth worſhip and ſerve him, he who perpetually
addicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to obſerve his Lawes and Commands, hee who heartily
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to pleaſe him, and actually doth pleaſe him; ſhould beleeve
both theſe points, and be ſtrongly perſwaded of them? For if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
not the exiſtence of God, that God is, how ſhould hee worſhip and ſerve
him? if he beleeve his exiſtence, and yet doubt of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and
righteouſneſſe, whether hee will be a Benefactor to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
and ſervitors, how ſhall they ſubject themſelves to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and
ſervice? Now to beleeve that God is, is to beleeve, that there is really
exiſtent ſuch a perſon in being, who hath the ſupreme power or command
over all things, who depends on no other perſon, but all other perſons and
things depend on him. For by the ſingle appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God, this is commonly
ſignified both here and elſewhere. And he that beleeveth ſuch a Dietie,
muſt thereupon withall neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve, that it is both eternall and
ſingular; for if it were not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſingular, it could not be
ſupreme. To ſeeke God, or enquire after God; is nothing elſe, but to
ſue for his grace and favour; as we are admoniſhed by the Prophet Eſay,
chap 55.6. <hi>Seeke yee the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him
while he is neere; let the wicked forſake <pb n="251" facs="tcp:61860:131"/>his way, and
the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord, and hee
will have mercy upon him.</hi> Here hee ſhewes us the way, how to ſeeke
God, Namely, by calling upon him; and the way to that (at leaſt to do it
effectually) is to forſake our unrighteouſnes, and ſinfulnes, and turn to
the Lord obſerving his laws and commands. Hence it appeares what is the
nature of that faith which commends us to God; for the Author teacheth it unto
us in this Chapter; and how farre ſuch faith differs from their faith, who
place faith in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and application of the merits of Chriſt.
It further appeares that faith in Chriſt is not contained in all faith in
God, in reſpect of all times; for in this deſcription and illuſtration of
that faith which the Author ſhews to have been in theſe ancient elders,
there is no mention of faith in Chriſt. Yet from the nature of faith in God
it is eaſie to collect, wherein the faith in Chriſt conſiſteth; namely,
that we beleeve that Chriſt is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek
him; or rather to expreſſe it in the words of this Author, It is to beleeve
<hi>that Chriſt is become the author of eternall ſalvation to all them that
obey him,</hi> chap. 5.9. For from this faith ariſeth a true confidence in
Chriſt, which naturally draws with it innocencie and holineſſe of life:
and by theſe we come to pleaſe God and Chriſt, and then being juſtified
by his grace, wee attaine the inheritance of eternall life. And this alſo may
be noted, as it will further appear by many of the following examples, That
Faith, if we take it properly and ſtrictly, doth differ from obedience from
comming to God and ſeeking him; becauſe faith muſt neceſſarily bee in
a man, before he can actually come to God and ſeek him; yet indeed the word
faith is oftentimes ſo ampliated and enlarged, as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in it all
the effects and fruits of it, even all the workes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and
righteouſneſſe. And in this argumentation of the Author (for we are
alſo to take notice of it) there is not more in the concluſion then was in
the premiſes. For from the premiſes, as the Author expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates them, it
ſeems nothing elſe would follow, but that Enoch was not tranſlated
without faith, and not that hee was tranſlated by, or through, or for his
faith, which is more, and is alſo concluded by the Author. But ſeeing
without faith we cannot pleaſe God, for faith is the true cauſe of our
pleaſing him; and ſeeing Enoch was therefore tranſlated becauſe he did
pleaſe God; hence moſt rationally it muſt be concluded, that Enochs faith
was the cauſe of his tranſlation; and conſequently he was tranſlated
by, for, through, or becauſe, and by reaſon of his faith. For whatſoever
is the cauſe of any effect, is alſo the cauſe of all things that follow
that effect. Now from this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Author, concluding Enochs
faith to be the cauſe of his tranſlation, it manifeſtly appeares, That
good workes, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent endeavour of them, whereby Enoch became to pleaſe
God, are not only the cauſe of eternall ſalvation, but in ſome reſpect
a cauſe of <pb n="252" facs="tcp:61860:132"/>it more immediate and nearer then faith.
For, for what cauſe was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch tranſlated? Was it not becauſe he
pleaſed God? But how came he to effect this? I ſuppoſe by his
righteouſneſſe, or as the Scripture expreſſeth it, by his walking
with God: But what was the cauſe that made him to walke with God, and really
endeavour with all his heart to pleaſe him? Certainly his faith cauſed
this; and further yet, What was the cauſe of his faith? Certainly one or both
thoſe principles whereof we treated in the firſt verſe of this Chapter;
Enoch had ſome evidence or ſight of ſomething unſeen, and he had ſome
ſubſtance of ſomething hoped; And what were they? Certainly the ſame
two points whereof the Author ſpake in the fifth verſe; for he had a
ſight of God who is unſeen, that he is; and ſecondly he had a
ſubſiſtance of hope, that God is a rewarder of them that diligently
ſeek him. This is the chaine, and theſe the ſeverall linkes whereof
Enochs tranſlation depends. For his evidence or ſight was the cauſe of
his hope, his hope the cauſe of his faith, his faith of his walking with God,
his walking with God of his pleaſing God, and his pleaſing God was the
cauſe of his tranſlation. Now if we goe backe by way of Reſolution,
through the ſeverall linkes of this chaine, we ſhall eaſily perceive,
that without the firſt linke none of the reſt can ſubſiſt, and ſo
conſequently no one that followeth can be without the former; and therefore
the Author with good reaſon faith that without faith, it is impoſſible to
pleaſe God; and by the like reaſon it will as neceſſarily follow, that
without good workes or walking with God, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him
alſo; as alſo without an evidence, or without a ſight of God; who is
unſeen, it is impoſſible to have faith. True it is, that faith is the
cauſe of our pleaſing God, and alſo of that eternall ſalvation which we
have from God; for what can be more pleaſing to the ſupreme Lord of all
things, then to ſee a man of whom God was never ſeen, to relye ſtrongly
and without any doubt of minde, upon his fidelity, bounty, goodneſſe,
righteouſneſſe, power and wiſdome? But faith hath yet another vertue no
leſſe then the former, whereby it procures our ſalvation as it were at a
great diſtance; namely, in working in us good workes or wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God,
and cauſing us to come to God, and ſeeke him, by ſuing to him for his
favour and grace in all our deſires, and all our deeds.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>By faith Noah being warned of God</hi>] The third
example is the faith of Noah, in that he beleeved the oracle of God, warning
him of things, whereof in the courſe of nature there was not the leaſt
appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Of this mans faith he teacheth us both what good is wrought in
him, and what good it brought unto him. The word faith here muſt not be
referred to the words immediately following, as if he had been <hi>warned of
God of things not yet ſeen,</hi> by his faith; but including thoſe words
with a comma, his faith appeals and coheres to the words <pb n="253" facs="tcp:61860:132"/>
                  <hi>moved with feare,</hi> and to the words following, <hi>he
prepared an Arke, &amp;c.</hi> This oracle or warning of God given him is
extant, Gen. 6.13. unto the end of the Chapter. <hi>Of things not ſeen as
yet</hi>] That is, of the future floud that was to come upon the world, which
then as yet was not only not ſeene, but there appeared no likelihood or
poſſibility of it, but what was drawne from Gods warning. <hi>Moved with
fear, prepared an Arke</hi>] Theſe were the effects of Noahs faith; firſt,
in that hee feared or was moved with feare, that God would bring upon the world
the puniſhment he had threatned; then from the faith of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and
the feare of it, he was further induced to frame the Arke as God appointed him,
that by means thereof he might eſcape the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by drowning the
world, and ſo ſave himſelfe and his family from deſtruction; and
therefore the Author addes, <hi>To the ſaving of his houſe</hi>] When the
floud came, Noah and his family to the number of eight perſons entered into
the Arke whereby they were ſaved, and all the reſt of the world was
drowned; all men and beaſts that were not in the Ark periſhed by the floud,
ſee Gen. 7. This faith of Noah is a good example to us for our imitation,
that we may learn to apply our ſelves to a firme faith and beliefe of Gods
oracles and predictions, whether they be promiſes concerning the future
bleſſedneſſe of the godly, or whether they bee menaces concerning the
future puniſhment of the wicked, and the miſerable deſtruction of the
whole world: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we timely provide our ſelves of an Arke, that
is, of meanes whereby we may eſcape the judgements of God, and bee ſaved
for ever. Now the Arke whereby we may eſcape from the finall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the whole world, and enter into the Tabernacle of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is the
Anſwer of a good conſcience toward God, as Peter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, 1 Epiſt.
3.21. <hi>By which he condemned the world.</hi> It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull
whether the relative <hi>which</hi> ſhould be referred, whether to Noahs
faith, or to the Arke, for the ſenſe ſeemes moſt inclining to the
former; but the words runne rather for the latter, partly becauſe the word
Arke ſtands neerer it, and partly becauſe of the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which
ſay, <hi>And became heire of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith.</hi>
Now if the word <hi>by which</hi> be referred to faith, the ſenſe will be
this: That Noah by his faith became heir of the righteouſneſſe which is
by faith; but this ſeems not proper: For can any man thinke, that Noah by his
faith could have obtained any other righteouſneſſe then that which comes
by faith? Neither doth the matter it ſelfe any way croſſe this ſenſe.
For although Noah condemned the world by his faith, yet he alſo condemned it
by the Arke; in as much as the Arke was a manifeſt proofe of his faith. For
unleſſe hee had beleeved the comming of the floud, hee would never have
prepared the Arke, to have loſt his labour therein, and make himſelfe
ridiculous to all the world. But he is ſaid to condemne the world, becauſe
by his faith <pb n="254" facs="tcp:61860:133"/>in beleeving the floud, and by his fact in
making the Arke, he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the world of obſtinacie, and thereby tooke
away all excuſe of ſin from them who would give no credence to God, by a
metaphor taken from accuſers, who are ſaid to condemne a guilty perſon,
in that they convict him of his crime, and by that means are the cauſe, that
hee is condemned; for properly to condemne is the act of the Judge. In this
ſenſe alſo Chriſt ſaith, That the men of Nineveh ſhall riſe in
judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this generation and condemne it. And the Queene of the South
ſhall riſe up in the judgement and condemne it, Matth. 12.41,42. For by the
fact of the Ninevites who reponted at the preaching of Jonas; and by the fact
of the Queen of the South who came from far to hear the wiſdome of Solomon,
the contumacie and obſtinacie of the Jewes is convinced, who deſpiſed
Chriſt that was preſent among them, and by many degrees greater and wiſer
then either Jonas or Solomon. Whence it came to paſſe that they were moſt
juſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of God. In like manner Noah, by his Faith and by his Arke
which was an evidence of his faith, convicted the obſtinacie of that world,
and brought it to paſſe that with very good juſtice God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it.
And as by his faith, and the effect of it, which was the Arke, he procured
condemnation to the world: ſo to himſelfe he procured righteouſneſſe;
for ſo it followes: <hi>And became heire of the righteouſnes which is by
faith</hi>] Righteouſneſſe is not here taken in a morall ſenſe, for
that righteouſneſſe which flows from good workes; but in a jurall
ſenſe, for that right whereby a man hath a title, to have hold and enjoy
ſome benefit or bleſſing from God; or for a right of liberty whereby a
man ſtands exempted and freed from thoſe burthens and puniſhments whereto
others are liable; for ſo it is taken in divers paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
eſpecially in Pauls Epiſtles, and ſo it muſt be taken here, as plainly
appeares from two grounds: Firſt, from the oppoſition of it to the word
condemned, in the former clauſe: For as to be condemned, is to be adjudged to
bee deprived of ſome benefit, and to loſe that right which a man had
before, whether it be loſſe of life, limb or goods; ſo on the contrary to
be juſtified, is to have ſome benefit adjudged unto him, or be inveſted
in a right to that whereto before, he had no right nor title. And as the
condemnation of the world, conſiſted in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God ſentencing
the people of it to loſe their lives by drowning in the floud: ſo the
righteouſneſſe or right of Noah conſiſted in the grant of God,
whereby God gave Noah a right, that he and his houſe ſhould bee ſaved
from that floud by means of the Arke, and Noah accepting of this grant by his
faith to beleeve it and reſt upon it, had thereby a right of ſalvation to
himſelfe and his Houſe. 2. From the conſequence of it to the word heire:
for men are not heires of morall righteouſneſſe, becauſe ſuch
righteouſneſſe is not a thing tranſient to be conveyed from one
perſon to another, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <pb n="255" facs="tcp:61860:133"/>is no way
inheritable, but men are heires of jurall rights, to thoſe perſons that
have the propertie or power to diſpoſe, convey, and grant ſuch rights
unto others. God granted Noah a right and title for him and his family, to be
ſaved from the flood by meanes of the Arke; and becauſe Noah accepted of
this grant by his faith, and teſtified his acceptance of it by his fact in
preparing the Ark, therefore he was heire to this right, and did inherit or
poſſeſſe it; for heire is a jurall word, and ſignifies one that hath
a right, whether <hi>in poſſe</hi> onely, or <hi>in eſſe.</hi> But from
this right of being ſaved, all the reſt of the world was diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.
<hi>i.</hi> They were condemned to bee drowned. And it is called a
righteouſneſſe or right by faith, becauſe the right hee had thus to bee
ſaved, proceeded from Gods ſpeciall grant, of Gods meere grace and proper
motion, without any deſert of it, or ſuit for it on the part of Noah. For
it is oppoſed to a right by workes, or to that right which is due by deſert
of works or ſervice. The Author therfore would intimate unto us, that Noah
had no right by any works of his, to deſerve this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſaving to him
and his houſe: but all the right he had came by his faith on his part, but
from the grace and favour of Gods grant on Gods part, which Noah accepting by
his faith was thereby ſetled upon him. And it is oppoſed to a right by
petition or ſuit, which hath the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the partie that
petitioneth or ſueth for it, and thereupon is granted, though then alſo it
be granted of meere grace and favour in him that conferres it. And thereby the
Authour would further inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate unto us, that Noah on his part made no petition
or ſuit to God for this benefit, for him and his family to be ſaved, and
therefore the firſt motion to have this right, proceeded not from Noah: but
God of his meere and proper motion without any ſuit made to him, propoſed
this benefit unto Noah, and promiſed him the grant of it freely and primely
from himſelfe; as appears in the ſacred ſtory where the thing is at large
related, Gen. 6.13. where wee read, that firſt God told Noah of the ſin of
the world, and then foretold him of the drowning of it; next taught him to
frame the Arke; and laſtly Covenanted with him to ſave him and his family
in it. Thus wee ſee the faith of Noah, and the effects of it; but what were
the cauſes of it, to effect and breed this faith in him? We ſhall finde by
inſpection into the words of this verſe, that Noah had in him the two
principles of faith, whereof wee ſpake in the firſt verſe. For he had an
evidence or ſight of a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene; for God had revealed and forewarned
him of the flood, which thing to him was yet unſeen. And he had in him a
ſubſiſtence of a thing hoped for; for God had Covenanted with him, and
promiſed him to ſave him and his family in the Ark, which ſalvation he
hoped for. So his fore-ſight of the flood to come, and his hope of being
ſaved from it by the Arke, were the cauſes to produce in him that faith,
whereby he was moved to feare the flood, and to prepare the Arke.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:61860:134"/>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was called to goe out into
a place, which hee ſhould after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and hee
went out not knowing whither he went.</hi>] The fourth example is of Abraham,
the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, upon whom the Authour doth much inlarge
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, relating many evidences and proofes of his faith. To Abraham he
ſubjoynes Iſaac and Jacob in thoſe particulars that were common to them.
And of Abrahams faith he mentions divers effects and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, as his
invincible courage and conſtancie, that wee might labour to imitate him, and
expreſſe the neereſt reſemblance of it wee can, as it becomes them who
profeſſe themſelves the children of Abraham. The firſt effect of his
faith was his obedience; for when God called and commanded him to goe out of
his countrey, unto a place which God would ſhew him; Abraham obeyed without
any ſcruple or delay and went out, not knowing whither hee went. And the
cauſes or reaſons of this faith, were as in the former perſons; Firſt,
an evidence or ſight of a thing unſeene, for God told him of a place or
countrey which was yet unſeen of him; And ſecondly, a ſubſiſtence of
a thing hoped for; for God had promiſed him, that hee ſhould receive that
place or countrey for an inheritance. So the foreſight of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to
come, and the hope to have it for an inheritance; were the cauſes to produce
in Abraham that faith, whereby he obeyed the call of God, and thereupon went
out of his own countrey, not knowing as yet whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went. There were many
reaſons on the contrary, to withdraw Abraham from this obedience, and to
remove him from ſo ſtrange a journey. For it was very hard eſpecially
upon no urgent neceſſitie, for a man to forſake his countrey, his
houſe, and lands, and poſſeſſions; to leave his kindred, friends, and
acquaintance, to wander without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine abode, and become a ſtranger in
a forraigne countrey. It ſeemes a raſh enterpriſe, for a man to prepare
himſelfe for a journey, before hee knowes whither hee ſhould goe, or to
what place hee ſhould tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile. But the faith of Abraham was ſo firme and
ſtrong, that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none of theſe thoughts, but vanquiſhed, and
baniſhed them all; being fully perſwaded, that no man could poſſibly
miſcarry in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, whatſoever the command might be, and how
raſh ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the enterpriſe might ſeeme. But wee muſt note that
Abraham did not leave his country to become a pilgrime and wanderer in the
world, upon any raſh or unadviſed motion of his owne, but <hi>he was called
to goe out</hi>] <hi>i.</hi> He was appointed and commanded to goe out; and the
perſon calling him to it was God: at whoſe word and command, he thought it
fit for him to leave his countrey and acquaintance. Whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes to us
an example, that when God commands and requires any thing of us, we ſhould
refuſe no burden, labour or trouble, no loſſe of countrey, friends or
fortunes, that we might fulfill his will. Yet when there is no juſt cauſe,
wee ſhould not by any raſh or fooliſh humour, <pb n="257" facs="tcp:61860:134"/>either deprive our ſelves of thoſe bleſſings that God hath
given us, or involve our ſelves in any calamity or miſery by an
unprofitable piety. For it is a more certaine triall of our faith, and a thing
more worthy, to doe and undergoe that at the command of God, or as our duty
requires, which otherwiſe we would not doe. Of this fact of Abraham, See Gen.
12.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe as
in a ſtrange countrey</hi>] Another effect of Abrahams faith, common to him
with Iſaac his ſon, and Jacob his nephew, which withall ſhews us, how
conſtant they alſo were in it. He ſojourned, by living there as an alien
or a ſtranger; for ſojourner in this ſence is oppoſed to a
<hi>native</hi> who lives in the ſame place where he was borne, enjoying it
by birth or right of inheritance. So we finde Paul oppoſing ſtrangers and
forraigners to fellow-citizens, Epheſ. 2.19. And the land wherein he
ſojourned was a ſtrange land unto him, partly becauſe he was not a native
of it, but onely a ſojourner or forraigner there; but chiefly becauſe he
had no right of inheritance for any preſent poſſeſſion there: for God
gave him no inheritance in it, not ſo much as to ſet his foote on, Acts
7.5. But it was onely the land of promiſe to him; for God had promiſed to
give the inheritance and poſſeſſion of it to him and his poſterity
after him, while yet he had neither poſterity nor childe, See againe, Acts
7.5. <hi>Dwelling in taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles</hi>] Here is expreſſed the reaſon why,
and the manner how Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is ſaid to ſojourne in the land of promiſe;
namely, becauſe he dwelt there in tabernacles; for this argues that to that
land he was a ſojourner or ſtranger, and that land to him was a ſtrange
countrey. For though God had promiſed to give it to him and his ſeed, yet
he for his owne particular never dwelt in it, as his owne demaine, but as a
ſtranger dwels in a ſtrange countrey among the natives of it. For he built
himſelfe neither City nor houſe to inhabite, but onely lived in Tabernacles
or tents, as ſtrangers doe, who have no certaine reſidence, nor make no
long abode in any place, but being alwayes ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move are for the time of
their ſtay covered onely with tents, and when they journey from one place to
another carry their houſes with them: for to them that have no
poſſeſſion of their own where they may make themſelves a fixed and
certaine ſeat, tents are the moſt commodious dwelling, becauſe they may
ſuddenly and eaſily tranſport them at their pleaſure. But hence is
drawne an evidence of Abrahams faith and his conſtancy therein, in that, to
ſhew his obedience to God, he lead a travelling life all his dayes; and
though the land were promiſed unto him, yet he neither founded City, nor
built houſe, neither did he either purchaſe or poſſeſſe any: but as
a flitting inhabitant; removed his tent from place to place, and wanting the
right of a native, lived there onely by tenure of curteſie. Yet he
poſſeſſed an aſſured hope, that after ſome few ages his
poſterity ſhould poſſeſſe that whole land, becauſe it 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61860:135"/>was the land of promiſe which the Lord had promiſed
him. <hi>With Iſaac and Iacob the heires with him of the ſame
promiſe</hi>] Iſaac and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob are not therefore joyned with Abraham, as if
Abraham had lived in tents all that time with both of them. For Iſaac being
borne many yeares after Abrahams comming into that land, could not all that
while live in Abrahams tent; and Jacob dwelt in the land after Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams death.
But they are therefore joyned with him, becauſe they alſo never came to the
poſſeſſion or inheritance of that land, but lived like ſojourners and
ſtrangers there as Abraham had done; for as they were heires of the ſame
promiſe, ſo they lived in the ſame manner. And hence is manifeſted
their faith and their conſtancy in it; becauſe their ſojourning in that
manner moved them not at all to doubt any thing of the faith and truth of Gods
promiſe, though the performance of it were ſo long delayed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>For he looked for a City which hath
foundations</hi>] Here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives the reaſon, why Abraham though he
had a promiſe of that land from God, yet was never put in poſſeſſion
of it, but dwelt there all his dayes in tents as a ſojourner and a
ſtranger. The reaſon hereof was, becauſe he expected or looked for a City
having foundations. Some man may doubt whether theſe words are to be
underſtood of Abrahams intent and purpoſe, or of the event that afterward
fell out. Certainely as we will not deny, but that Abraham hoped to have from
God ſome life and happineſſe after his death, in regard he knew the great
goodneſſe of God toward his ſervitors, and the great power of God, that
he is able to raiſe even the dead, and can give his ſervants a bleſſing
or reward after their death: and withall did eaſily perceive the vanity of
earthly happineſſe, eſpecially now in his declining yeares; and might
have a deſire of a re-ſurviving life to befall him after his death, a thing
that ſeemes naturall to all men living: Yet he that ſhall conſult the
Sacred hiſtory and ſhall diligently both reade and relect it, ſhall finde
nothing either written or any way intimated concerning that matter. But this
divine Author, relating examples from the holy Scriptures upon their authority
and infallibility, ſeemes not to ſay or affirme any particular concerning
thoſe holy Elders, but what is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the holy Scriptures. Yet that
Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, had a hope not onely of ſome life and
happineſſe after death, but alſo of a City which hath foundations, that
is, of heaven it ſelfe, and that heavenly happineſſe which ſhall never
determine or have end; and upon that hope did undergoe all the travels and
troubles of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pilgrimage, to leade alwayes an uncertaine and
flitting life, this the holy Scriptures have no where diſcovered. Yea rather,
what hopes Abraham ſometime had in this reſpect, it may hence appeare, in
that while he was yet deſtitute of children, when God ſpake to him and
ſaid, <hi>Feare not Abraham, I am thy ſhield and thy exceeding great
reward,</hi> 
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:61860:135"/>Abraham anſwered, <hi>Lord God, what wilt
thou give me, ſeeing I go child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and the ſteward of my houſe is
this Eliezer of Damaſcus; and behold one borne in my houſe is mine
heire?</hi> Gen. 15.1,2. Doth it not hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the ſumme of all
Abrahams deſires came to this, that hee might leave behinde him a ſonne and
heire of his owne body, ſeeing he abounded already in all other goods and
riches. For if at that time he had with any firme hope conceived of heaven it
ſelfe, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſſe thereof, when God promiſed him
an exceeding great reward, would he have anſwered, <hi>Lord God, what wilt
thou give me?</hi> For in theſe words he ſignified, that God had already
abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded him, and given him goods in a full meaſure, and to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him more was to no purpoſe, ſeeing he had no childe of his owne
to whom hee might leave his eſtate. Whence it appeares, that Abraham extended
not that exceeding great reward which God promiſed him, beyond the goods and
happineſſe of this life. Wherefore it is more likely, that in theſe words
of Abrahams expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance the Author intended not to give a reaſon, why Abraham
indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſuch conſtancie the toyles of a continuall pilgrimage, and of
a life alwayes unſetled; but rather of the event (as we ſaid) why God gave
Abraham no poſſeſſion in that land to inherit as his owne proper right;
granted him no City to dwell in, nor ſeat where to ſettle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but
would have him dwell in tents with his ſonne, and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe: Namely,
becauſe (as afterward at the ſixteenth verſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith) God had
prepared for him a City infinitly greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all the land of
promiſe, with all the Cities in it. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God made to
Abraham and his ſeed doe in the myſticall ſenſe containe this
ſpirituall happineſſe and heavenly inheritance. And in the ſame
ſenſe the ſeed of Abraham, doth ſignifie the ſeed of all the
faithfull, who follow the faith of Abraham. For both theſe ſenſes are
taught us by the Apoſtle, Rom. 4.11,12,13. and Gal. 3.7. and Gal. 4 22.
Therefore Abraham expected or looked for a City which hath foundations, rather
by reaſon of the event and purpoſe of God, then from any intent and
purpoſe of his owne, whereby he might ſeem to fore know it. For in this
ſenſe we many times attribute expectation to a thing: ſo this Author,
Chap. 10. ver. 27. ſaith, that to them who ſinne willingly, there remaines
a certaine fearfull expectation or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for of judgement; whereas if we
referre this to their intent and purpoſe of minde, ſinners moſt times
expect and looke for nothing leſſe then the puniſhment of their ſinnes.
Abraham then is therefore ſaid to looke for this City, becauſe this City
was by Gods decree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and appointed for him; and becauſe his faith
was ſo conſtant in God, neither broken, nor ſhaken with any travels or
troubles, and his whole courſe of life was ſuch as theirs is, who relying
upon Gods promiſe do really expect this heavenly City, as a reward of their
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: <pb n="260" facs="tcp:61860:136"/>Whereof the firſt is ſpoken by way of
Metonymie, putting the effect for the cauſe; and this latter is ſaid by way
of Metaphor. This City the Author oppoſeth to Tabernacles and Tents; and the
matter is not great to live a while in a Tent, that afterward we may live for
ever in a City. And it is a <hi>City that hath foundations;</hi> By which
attribute, Heaven is oppoſed not only to Tabernacles or Tents which have no
foundations; but to all Cities, which though they have foundations, yet in
compariſon of Heaven they have none, becauſe they have none ſuch. And
hereby is ſignified unto us the firmneſſe and ſtrength of our heavenly
City; which no force, no tract of time, no change of things can poſſibly
ſhake or move; which ſhall not be ruined by the ruine of that heaven and
earth, which to us is viſible; whereof ſee the Author afterward, Chap. 12.
ver. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi>] Certainly that
City muſt needs be moſt ſtable &amp; ample, moſt beautifull and
plentifull of all happineſſe, which had ſuch a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſuch a
maker as God to found and raiſe it. He oppoſeth God to men, who are the
founders and builders of all earthly Cities. And therefore this City muſt
needs be ſo divine and heavenly, ſo firme and ſtrong, that no hand of man
can prevaile againſt it. Cities built by men, by men may be deſtroyed, and
many times are ſo: but the City whereof God is the builder and maker, is
ſecure and ſafe from all hazard.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>By faith alſo Sara her ſelfe received
ſtrength to receive ſeed, and was delivered of a child when ſhe was
paſt age</hi>] It may here be doubted, whether the Author doth ſpeak here
of the faith of Sarah or of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, as he firſt began, and afterward goes
on. The former of theſe ſeems to be gathered firſt from the words of the
Author, when hee ſaith, Sarah her ſelfe. For it ſeems as much as if he
had ſaid, Not only Abraham, but alſo Sarah her ſelfe, by faith received
ſtrength: So that he joynes Sarah with Abraham in reſpect of her faith.
Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words, <hi>She judged him faithfull</hi>] which follow
in the next clauſe of this verſe, ſeem to be referred to the next
antecedent which is Sarah. But the latter opinion ſeems perſwaſible;
Firſt, becauſe the Author firſt began, and afterward proceeds to ſpeake
of the faith of Abraham. Secondly, becauſe the ſacred Hiſtory, mentions
not the faith of Sarah, when Iſaac was promiſed; but rather the Scripture
ſeems to mention ſomething contrary to her faith; for ſhee laughed within
her ſelfe, ſaying, After I am waxed old, ſhall I have pleaſure, my Lord
being old alſo? and the Angell queſtioned Abraham upon it, to know the
cauſe of it, ſaying, Wherefore did Sarah laugh? Is any thing too hard for
the Lord? Gen. 18.12,13. Whence alſo Paul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon the ſame
point mentions only the ſtrength of Abrahams faith, Rom. 4.19. Thirdly,
becauſe in the next verſe following, where the effect and fruit of this
faith is deſcribed, no mention is made of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, <pb n="261" facs="tcp:61860:136"/>but
only of Abraham; namely in theſe words, <hi>Therefore ſprang there even of
one, and him as good as dead ſo many as the ſtars of the skie in
multitude</hi>] Whereupon we may well doubt, which of theſe two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſhould be embraced, ſeeing the reaſons brought on either ſide may
eaſily bee anſwered. For to the firſt reaſon for the firſt opinion we
may ſay; That the Author therefore ſaith, <hi>Through faith Sarah her
ſelfe</hi>] to ſhew us, that by the faith of Abraham it came to paſſe,
that not only himſelfe ſhould have power to beget a ſonne, though he were
then old and barren; but alſo that Sarah her ſelfe ſhould conceive, who
was by nature alwayes barren even in her youth, and beſides was then ſpent
out with yeares and age, yet ſhe ſhould both conceive and bring forth
beyond all courſe of nature. To the ſecond reaſon we may anſwer, That
is is not neceſſary, that the words <hi>judged him faithfull</hi>] ſhould
be referred to the next antecedent; but rather to that which is the principall
antecedent, though it be more remote; as we ſee it done in the verſe
following, wherein the reference is manifeſtly made to Abraham. Neither is
the anſwer difficult to the arguments of the latter opinion. To the firſt,
it may be ſaid, That the Author, as a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he joyned Iſaac and
Jacob with Abraham for dwelling in tents as a thing common to them all; ſo
alſo here he might joyne Sarah with her husband Abraham in a matter common to
them both. For in mentioning afterward the ſpeciall fact of Abraham in
offering Iſaac, therein the Author would ſeem to obſerve the order of
actions and of time. For firſt he muſt handle Iſaacs birth, and the faith
of Abraham concerning it, before he come to the offering of Iſaac and
Abrahams faith about that. To the ſecond, Although from Sarahs laughing, and
from the cauſe of it, which is there expreſſed, and from the anſwer of
the Lord, wherein hee reproved Sarah for laughing, it appears, That the
promiſe made her for the bringing forth of a ſon within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of the yeare, ſeemed at the firſt hearing ridiculous to her, and a thing
not credible; eſpecially ſeeing ſhe ſeemed not yet to know who the
priſon was that promiſed it; (for if we looke into the context of the
Hiſtory, it is plaine, that Abraham himſelfe did not marke that the
perſons who ſpake with him were Angels of God, till their ſpeech touching
Sarah his wife) yet it follows not, but that afterward, when ſhe had
recollected her ſelfe, and had obſerved the divine Authority of the
ſpeaker, and perceived that the cauſe of her doubtfulneſſe was
ſtrongly refuted by him, ſhe continued no longer in her
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ancie and doubting; yea the
contrary is more probable both in it ſelfe, and collectively from hence, that
upon her hearing of the Angels reproofe, ſhe was terrified, and for feare
denied ſhee had laughed. For from whence came this terror and feare upon her,
but becauſe ſhe now had obſerved, that ſhe had not to deale with a man,
but with God, whoſe ſayings and promiſes to laugh at, or diſtruſt,
was altogether unlawfull <pb n="262" facs="tcp:61860:137"/>for her, though to her judgement
they ſurpaſſed the whole force and courſe of nature? We ſee that
Abraham himſelfe laughed alſo for the ſame cauſe, when firſt God
promiſed him a ſon by Sarah; as wee may read, Gen. 17.17. not that he
doubted any thing of the faith or power of him that promiſed it; for in the
fore-cited place to the Romans, Paul openly teſtifies the contrary; but
becauſe the matter in it ſelfe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, eſpecially heard upon the
ſuddaine and at unawares, ſeemed to him in a manner abſurd and
ridiculous, and ſcarce credible. But when he had intended his thoughts upon
God that promiſed him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his promiſe to be ſerious, he
became certaine of the power and ſaith of God, and doubted not at all. And
the Virgin Mary, when firſt ſhe heard it from the Angel, that ſhe
ſhould conceive and bring forth a ſon, ſhe replyed, <hi>How ſhall this
be, ſeeing I know not a man?</hi> Luke 1.34. From which words it appears,
that at her firſt hearing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels words, there aroſe ſome
ſcruple and doubt in her minde, which when the Angel had removed by his
anſwer, ſhe reſted wholly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For which cauſe Elizabeth
afterward calls her bleſſed, <hi>And bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is ſhe that
beleeved,</hi> Luke 1.45. To the third; The following verſe therefore treats
of Abraham, becauſe this verſe treats not of Sarah a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; but Abraham is
joyned with her, in theſe words, <hi>Through faith alſo Sarah
herſelfe.</hi> For the particle <hi>alſo</hi> ſhews, that beſides Sarah
hee intends ſome other perſon; namely, Abraham whom he named before.
Notwithſtanding all this; yet to us it ſeems more probable, that theſe
words of the Author ſhould be referred to Abrahams faith, as well as the
reſt; and that his faith is herein alſo commended, in that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſo admirable an effect not only in himſelfe, being now old, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in
Sarah his wife, who was not only old, but had been hitherto bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. Although
it ſeems, the Author did ſo temper his words on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as that Sarah
might be admitted into the fellowſhip and glory of that faith with her
husband Abraham. <hi>Becauſe ſhee judged him faithfull who had
promiſed.</hi>] Hence it appears that God is not only pleaſed with our
obedience to his commands, but alſo with our faith given to his promiſes;
when we by our faith judge him to be faithfull, <hi>i.</hi> conſtant and true
of his word, alwayes certaine to performe the thing hee hath promiſed.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Therefore ſprang there even of one, and him as
good as dead, ſo many as the ſtars of the skie in multitude, and as the
ſand which is by the ſea ſhore innumerable.</hi>] As if he had ſaid,
The faith of Abraham was ſo effectuall and fruitfull, that by reaſon
thereof it came to paſſe, that not only Sarah conceived and bare a ſon;
but alſo by this ſon, who was but one, and came from Abraham one man, and
he a barren man, as good as dead, there was propagated a poſterity
innumerable. The Author in this verſe, hath relation to Gods promiſe,
wherein Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was promiſed a ſeed and a poſterity anſwerable in
number to the <pb n="263" facs="tcp:61860:137"/>ſtarres of heaven, and to the ſands of
the ſea, Gen. 15.5. and Gen. 22.17. The Author expreſſeth the effect of
Gods promiſe, which might be ſeene with the eye, that by experience it
might appeare, what faith and force there is in the promiſes of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Theſe all dyed in faith, not having received
the promiſes</hi>] He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the conſtancy of their faith, in that all
theſe departed this life under faith, <hi>i.</hi> holding the faith of the
promiſes, and certainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the future performance of them, though
themſelves obtained not the effect of the promiſes or the things
promiſed. For the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were to be fulfilled not onely after their
death, but many ages after. The word promiſes is here by way of a Metonymy
put materially for the matter of the promiſe or the things promiſed. In
like manner, we muſt endeavour to be conſtant in the faith to the laſt
gaſpe of our life; and not onely be in certaine hope of thoſe things which
God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for us here in this life; but of thoſe alſo which are to
accrue to us after our death, and it may be many ages after. <hi>But having
ſeene them afarre off</hi>] They ſaw not the effect of Gods promiſes
actually fulfilled, or neere to their fulfilling, but they had as it were a
proſpect of them a farre off. They foreſaw in their minde the performance
of them farre remote from themſelves by a great diſtance of time, to be
fulfilled in their poſterity after many ages. So they ſaw the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
by faith, becauſe they had an evidence or ſight of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance not
ſeene. As it befell unto Abraham, who in a deepe ſleepe ſaw in a
viſion, that foure generations muſt expire, and that his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
muſt endure a heavy ſervitude, before they ſhould take poſſeſſion
of the inheritance promiſed. And without all doubt Abraham impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that
viſion to his ſon Iſaac, and Iſaac unto Jacob. <hi>And were
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them, and embraced them</hi>] Though they ſaw that theſe
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for their effect and performance were for the future very remote
from them for ſeverall ages to come, yet they no way doubted of their
performance, but were fully perſwaded they ſhould be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe
they were fully perſwaded that God who made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes was faithfull to
performe them. And they were not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them, but they
<hi>embraced them;</hi> for which the word in the Originall is, they
<hi>ſaluted them,</hi> and ſo ſome Tranſlations render it. Now
<hi>ſaluting</hi> is but a Metaphor for <hi>embracing;</hi> becauſe
ſalutings are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly performed by way of embracing. The ſence therefore
is, that thoſe Patriarchs did in their ſoule embrace and kiſſe thoſe
promiſes of God, and with an undoubted faith conceiving them already
preſent, did ſalute and embrace them, as friends uſe to ſalute and
embrace their friends that after a long travaile returne from a forraine
countrey. For by this word, nothing elſe is ſignified, but that they
nothing doubted of the performance of Gods promiſes, but did welcome them in
their ſoules, as if the things they looked for, were already come. <hi>And
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <pb n="264" facs="tcp:61860:138"/>that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on
the earth</hi>] The intent of theſe words is to prove, that thoſe
Patriarcks while they lived, did not receive thoſe promiſes, by
poſſeſſing any inheritance in the land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; for otherwiſe
they would not have confeſſed themſelves ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrims in the
land. But that they did confeſſe themſelves pilgrims and ſtrangers in
that land, it appeares both by the words of Abraham, who requeſting to have a
ſepulchre in the land of Canaan, wherein to bury his dead, ſpake thus to
the ſons of Heth. <hi>I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a ſojourner with you, give me
a poſſeſsion of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of
my ſight,</hi> Gen. 23.4. And by the words of Jacob to Pharoah; for when the
King asked him how old he was, Jacob anſwered, <hi>The dayes of the yeares of
my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty yeares; few and evill have the dayes of
my life beene, and have not attained unto the dayes of the yeares of the life
of my fathers in the dayes of their pilgrimage,</hi> Gen. 47.9. In which words
he affirmes, that he and his Anceſtors, Abraham and Iſaac were pilgrims all
the time of their lives. <hi>On the earth.</hi>] This muſt not be
reſtrained to the land of Canaan onely, promiſed to them and their
poſterity: but it is in effect as much as if he had ſaid, that they had no
proper countrey at all upon earth, no place which was their owne by
poſſeſſion and proper right.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>For they that ſay ſuch things, declare
plainly that they ſeeke a Countrey</hi>] If the particle <hi>for</hi> may be
thought in this place to retaine it force, then the Author ſhews the
conſequence, why from this their confeſſion it appeares, that during
their life they received not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And the reaſon is, becauſe
they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeeke a countrey.
For if they ſought a countrey, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely then they had no countrey: But a
Countrey was promiſed them, and a land which they ſhould poſſeſſe
by a proper and heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right, and not by courteſie onely as ſtrangers
and ſojourners. But it is more probable, that the particle <hi>for</hi> is
here ſet for <hi>but;</hi> as if the Author had ſomething more to ſpeake
of theſe Patriarcks, beſides what he had already ſaid, and would conclude
ſomething further from this their confeſſion, thereby to make way for
what followes concerning their ſeeking of a heavenly countrey. And they are
ſaid to ſeeke a Countrey, becauſe they wanted and deſired a countrey,
as appeares at the ſixteenth verſe following. For they who live a pilgrims
life upon earth, having no ſetled abode, and are touched with a ſence of
their condition, cannot chuſe but be weary of their flitting and toſſing
from place to place, and thereupon be deſirous of a countrey, <hi>i.</hi>
ſome proper ſoile of their owne, where they may ſettle themſelves and
live at reſt. Beſides, they undertooke theſe pilgrimages and
ſojournings at Gods command, that at laſt they might have a reſidence in
a countrey and a land appointed to them by God. After the Author had proved
that <pb n="265" facs="tcp:61860:138"/>they ſought and deſired a countrey, now he
proceeds further to ſhew, what countrey they ſought and deſired.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And truly if they had beene mindfull of that
countrey from whence they came out</hi>] Before he ſpecifie what countrey
they ſought and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; firſt he ſhews that they ſought not, nor
deſired, no nor minded that countrey from which Abraham departed by Gods
command. For if they had had any minde or thought of that countrey, or had
deſired it, when they confeſſed themſelves pilgrims, they might have
returned, ſeeing they had time enough for a returne. But they minded it not,
and therefore deſired it not; for what we deſire we do not only minde, but
we grieve for the abſence and want of it. Abraham alone onely with his wife
went out of the countrey which was properly his as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a native of it: but
Iſaac his ſon, and Jacob his grand child may in a manner be ſaid to have
gone out in him; in as much as they continued in the purpoſe and reſolution
of Abraham and would not returne thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>They might have had opportunity
to have returned</hi>] Becauſe therefore they returned not into their
countrey, for they ſojourned from it for ſome hundreds of yeares, wherein
they had opportunities and time enough for ſuch an enterpriſe, hence it
plainly appeares, they were no way mindfull or deſirous to returne to that
countrey from whence Abraham departed.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>But now they deſire a better countrey</hi>]
Here the Author inferres that now they deſire a better countrey then the
former, and doe ſeeke it with all their ſoules. The particle <hi>but
now</hi> is commonly adverſative onely, and all one with <hi>but</hi> as we
have formerly noted; but here in this place it carryeth alſo with it a
ſence and force concluſive; as if he had ſaid: Seeing therefore they
ſeeke and deſire a countrey, yet neither ſeeke nor deſire the former
whence Abraham departed, it muſt needs therefore now follow, that they
ſeeke and deſire a better countrey then that. For if it were not better,
but onely as good or worſe, there could be no reaſon, why they ſhould
deſert the former, and with ſo great labour and care ſeeke another. Yet
the Author uſed in this place the adverſative particle <hi>but,</hi> by
reaſon of the oppoſition betweene theſe and the former words. <hi>They
deſire</hi>] the tenſe preſent for the preter tenſe they did deſire;
as is commonly uſe in argumentations, and many times in narrations;
eſpecially when the hiſtory regards not the point of time, but keepes
cloſe to the matter, and that ſhe may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſent things to our
view, ſpeakes of them rather as preſent, then paſt. <hi>That is an
heavenly</hi>] Here the Author expreſſeth in his owne judgement, as well
knowing the purpoſe of God in that point, what better countrey it was which
they deſired. For it is not neceſſary, we ſhould thinke, that thoſe
Patriarchs did expect this heavenly countrey by intent and purpoſe of minde,
as hath beene already declared before, ver. 10. but it ſufficeth, that this
ſhould be the event of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="266" facs="tcp:61860:139"/>and deſire,
from the Decree of God, who in a myſterious and concealed way, had promiſed
them this heavenly countrey; and that it ſhould not thus farre come to
paſſe without their deſire, in as much as they deſired a better
countrey then that which they had relinquiſhed. For a better countrey then
this heavenly, which by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was reſerved for them, and ſhould
in time accrue unto them, there could bee none. Whence alſo if a thing befall
a man ſutable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, though it be, or prove much better then hee
hoped or imagined, yet wee uſually ſay, hee ſought and deſired, it:
eſpecially if the courſe of his life and endeavours bee ſo compoſed,
that the iſſue and event might well be ſuch; which certainely was
performed by thoſe Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs. For their very pilgrimage upon earth, this
very thing, that they had no proper and ſetled abode of their owne upon
earth, though they were moſt deare to God, the ſupreme Lord of all things,
how fitly doth it ſuit with this iſſue and event, that being pilgrims and
ſtrangers upon earth, they ſhould at laſt by Gods goodneſſe be
ſetled in heaven as in their countrey? For why elſe did not God give them a
ſetled countrey, and a certaine abode upon earth? Therefore even thoſe
words, wherby they confeſſed themſelves pilgrims and ſtrangers upon
earth, were not uttered but by the Spirit of God; becauſe by them was
ſignified, that they were not citizens of earth, but of heaven, which was
their countrey. Becauſe therefore this heavenly countrey was in the purpoſe
of God, to be better then that countrey, which the Patriarchs deſired,
therefore with good reaſon are they ſaid to deſire this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
countrey. But if we looke into their intent and purpoſe, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which
they deſired, was the poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for
their poſteritie. Of ſo great advantage it was, to leave their petty
dwellings in their owne countrey, that they might ſettle their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie
in poſſeſſion of a whole kingdom, and place them in the eternall and
peculiar favour of God. <hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed to bee called their
God.</hi>] God therefore was not aſhamed of them, becauſe after they were
dead, God both calls himſelfe their God, and ſuffers others to call him
ſo, yea hee would be called ſo. Certainely it is a great matter, that the
moſt high God, who is the maker of heaven and earth, would be called the God
of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, and would not bee aſhamed of that title. For
what is Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob? men dead and rotten long ſince; who
while they lived were exiles fom their countrey, and vagrants upon earth,
having no certaine abode all their whole life. From theſe mens names, the
onely Lord and ruler of all things, diſdained not to take his ſirname. But
to be the God of ſome perſon, eſpecially when God utters it himſelf of
himſelf, ſignifies that he is the chiefe Patron and Protectour of that
perſon, who will defend his client and worſhipper from all evill, and
benefit him with his beſt bleſſings: but when man utters it of God, it
often ſignifies that God is <pb n="267" facs="tcp:61860:139"/>his ſupreme Lord, whom he
worſhips and obeyes in all his commands with all his ſoule. And this
inference of the Author from his former paſſages, is an argument, that he
ſpake of the event of the deſire and vote of thoſe Patriarchs, and not of
any intent and purpoſe in their mind to ſeek and expect that heavenly
countrey. For it appeares not from Scripture, that God was therefore not
aſhamed of them, becauſe they had an intent and purpoſe of minde to
ſeeke and deſire that heavenly countrey: but becauſe God had decreed to
reſtore them to life, and to put them in poſſeſſion of that countrey,
as the Authour willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate himſelfe, and to ſhew more clearly the
conſequence of what he inferres, doth therefore ſubjoyne; <hi>For hee hath
prepared for them a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> For he brings not here a new reaſon, why God
was not aſhamed to be, and be called the God of thoſe Patriarchs; but hee
onely propoſeth his former reaſon more openly and clearly. For we uſe
not, when wee have concluded a truth, and inferred it as firme and certaine
from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principles, to confirme it abruptly with an argument and reaſon,
as if it were not yet proved, ſo as to leave no marke, that we bring a new
reaſon different from the former; becauſe then God had ordained that
heavenly countrey and kingdom for Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with
good right and reaſon doth hee call himſelfe their Lord and Patron. This
the Author without doubt had learned from thoſe words of Chriſt, whereby he
proves the Reſurrection of the dead from hence, becauſe God calls
himſelfe the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, who then were long dead. For
hence Chriſt doth gather, that ſeeing God cannot be the God of the dead,
namely, if they never be reſtored to life; (for how can God benefit the dead,
unleſſe he firſt raiſe them?) therefore it muſt needs follow, that if
he call himſelfe the God of ſome dead, as he did of thoſe dead
Patriarchs, then ſome of the dead muſt at length be recalled to life, that
God may be their God in very deed, by accumulating and furniſhing them with
his benefits and bleſſings. But as in the ſame place Chriſt ſaith a
little before; <hi>They which ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to obtaine that
world, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in
marriage; neither can they die any more; for they are equall unto the angels,
and are the children of God, being the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the reſurrection.</hi>
Luke 20.35,36. What is all this elſe, but to be an heire and a citizen of
that heavenly countrey and city? We ſee then that a heavenly countrey and
city is prepared and ordained for Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob: and therefore
why ſhould wee doubt, but that the very ſame is reſerved alſo for all
us that are the worſhippers and ſervitors of God? which right of ours wee
need not ſtand to evict from divers evidences and dark conſequences;
ſeeing hereof wee have not only moſt open and clear promiſes, which to
thoſe Patriarchs were never declared; but alſo we know for certain, that
Chriſt our head doth now enjoy the poſſeſſion of that countrey and
city. This only remaines <pb n="268" facs="tcp:61860:140"/>for us, that following the
example of thoſe Patriarks, and much rather of Chriſt our Captaine, wee
ſhould finally carry our ſelves obedient unto God, and extending our hopes
beyond our death, ſhould doe our utmoſt endeavour, that our life ſhould
firſt fail us, before we fail of our faith and allegiance toward God.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tryed, offered up
Iſaac.</hi>] The Author here mentions an example of Abrahams faith, which of
all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was moſt illuſtrious; namely, his offering up of Iſaac; the
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whereof the Authour doth but lightly touch, as a thing
ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known, and at large deſcribed in the ſacred Scriptures.
<hi>Offered;</hi> Abraham offered him not really and actually but (which is all
one with God) purpoſely, with an unchangeable and conſtant purpoſe of
minde, with as much endeavour as lay in his power, and proceeding ſo farre in
the action, as had not God recalled him, the effect undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had followed.
Thus he offered him; and not onely ſlew him; for the ſlaughter ſhould
have preceded, and then the offering muſt have followed by fire for a
burnt-offering; for ſo God had commanded. <hi>When hee was tryed.</hi>] For
of his own election or accord it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have come into his heart, to have
ſacificed unto God, who doth moſt abhorre crueltie, with the bloud of man,
muchleſſe of his owne ſon, unleſſe he had beene commanded of God to
it: And he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do it, not that he ſhould actually perform it;
but that by his willingneſſe to performe it, and by obeying Gods Command,
as farre as in him lay, hee ſhould give an aſſured triall of his faith.
<hi>And he that had received the promiſes offered up his only begotten
ſonne</hi>] What a ſtrange fact was this of a ſtrange faith? where not
only the father offered up his ſon, but his only begotten ſon; and what
father was it? even he who had received the promiſes, who from the ſame
mouth of God had received the promiſes of a ſeed &amp; a poſterity to be
propagated by Iſaac, and had confidently beleeved it, he now received a
command to ſlay Iſaac before there was any iſſue from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
truly here alſo Abraham may be ſaid to have <hi>beleeved in hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
hope,</hi> that we uſe the Apoſtles words ſpeaking of another point of
his faith; who as a little after we ſhall ſhew, doubted not to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
together two things claſhing and croſſing one another, namely the life
and death of the ſame perſon, becauſe it was God who had ſpake
concerning both. We may further adde here other circumſtances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the hiſtory, as that three dayes journey with his ſonne to a place
aſſigned him by God; with that thoughts and cares ſhall wee think the
ſoule of the poor father was agitated, journying toward the reſolved
ſlaughter of his deare and only ſonne, whom he drew on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him,
ignorant of his deſtined calamity, to become a ſacrifice and a
burnt-offering? what ſpirits were in him may we imagine, when upon his
aſſent up that fatall Mount, he laid the wood upon his ſonne 
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61860:140"/>wherewith a fire ſhould be kindled to burne him after
his father had ſlaine him? what thought he, when his ſonne perceiving no
ſacrifice beſides himſelfe, and marvelling at the matter, did gently
demand of his father, where was the Lambe for the burnt-offering? what thought
he, when ſeaſing upon his ſonne with his owne hands expecting no ſuch
dealing from ſo dear a father, he bound him, and laid him on the Altar upon
the wood? when he drew his knife, and ſtanding over him eyed his throat, and
ſtretched forth his heavy hand that ſhook and trembled with fatherly love?
which of us all reading and conſidering all theſe, findes not his ſoule
melting in him? yet the invincible faith of Abraham conquered all theſe. And
Iſaac is called the <hi>only begotten ſonne of Abraham,</hi> or as it is in
the Hebrew his <hi>only ſonne,</hi> not that hee only was his ſonne (for
Iſmael alſo was his ſonne) but becauſe he was his only ſonne by Sarah
the true wife of Abraham; and becauſe hee was his only beloved ſonne, that
was borne to his parents in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme old age, by the ſingular gift and
wondrous power of God; and becauſe he was to be the only heire of his fathers
eſtate, and of Gods promiſes; and becauſe the ſeed of Abraham was to
bee called in him only, for the children of Iſaac only were to be accounted
the true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of Abraham. <hi>And he that received the promiſes</hi>]
The pronoune <hi>he,</hi> whether we thinke it relative to Iſaac, or to
Abraham (which is better) yet the ſenſe is the ſame, doth notifie unto us
a notable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this fact, that makes the faith of Abraham to
appear yet much greater. Certainly that faith is very great, which is ſeen
and tryed in hard caſes, as was the offering of an only ſonne. But how much
grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is that faith which ſtaggereth not at ſuch an action, as naturally
would utterly overthrow it? Yet ſuch was this fact of Abraham: Abraham had
received promiſes from God, whereof one was that a numerous poſterity
ſhould be borne of him; the other, that the land of Canaan wherein he was a
ſojourner and a ſtranger ſhould be given in poſſeſſion to his
poſterity. Theſe promiſes Abraham had from God and he beleeved both of
them with all his heart, as it is ſignified by the word <hi>received;</hi>
and beleeving theſe promiſes he ſhewed himſelfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to all Gods
commands, that he might not faile of his hope from ſo great bleſſings.
Now what command doth God lay upon him? God commands him to take Iſaac his
ſonne, in whoſe poſterity all thoſe promiſes were to be fulfilled,
and from whom as yet he had no grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, yet him he muſt offer up, that
is, he muſt ſlay and burne him for a ſacrifice. If Abraham muſt doe
this, and looke into the nature of the action, could he poſſibly have any
hope of thoſe promiſes?</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Of whom it was ſaid that in Iſaac ſhall thy
ſeed be called</hi>] This is therefore added, leſt any man ſhould thinke,
that Abraham might imagine, though Iſaac were extinct, yet the promiſes
might have their iſſue in Iſmael. For Abraham could not imagine this,
becauſe God <pb n="270" facs="tcp:61860:141"/>had ſaid unto him, <hi>in Iſaac ſhall
thy ſeed be called;</hi> that is, the children to be borne of Iſaac,
ſhall be accounted thy ſeed and poſterity; namely, that thy poſterity
for whom I have ordained my bleſſing, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that
land: and therefore Iſaacs children only ſhall be called the poſterity of
Abraham. In this perplexity then and contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the promiſe and the
command, what iſſue could Abraham find for his faith? To doubt of Gods
promiſes and of their performance, he thought it impiety, and therefore he
obeyed Gods command for the offering up of Iſaac. But then conſidering,
that this ſacrifice would in the eye of nature overthrow all his hope,
therefore he builds a new and high faith upon the ground of his former faith;
namely,</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Accounting that God was able to raiſe him up
even from the daed</hi>] This way onely the paſſage was open, for Abraham
to beleeve, that God was able to raiſe Iſaac even from the dead. This point
he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, though he had no preſident or example for it. For he would
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſcend up to the higheſt pitch of faith, then relapſe or retire
in any degree; and would rather cumulate a high faith with a higher, then make
the leaſt doubt of Gods promiſes. <hi>Accounting,</hi> is in the Greeke
<hi>reaſoning;</hi> after he had reaſoned within himſelfe, caſting up
all the wayes poſſible, how to ſalve up Gods command with Gods promiſe,
at laſt hee determined and concluded a poſſibility this way. And which
way was that? that though he ſhould ſlay Iſaac, and offer him up to God
as a burnt-offering, <hi>yet God was able to raiſe him up even from the
dead.</hi> This was the ſumme of his account and the concluſion of his
reaſoning, that God was Almighty and able to doe, not only all other things
that are eaſily done, but even to raiſe from the dead; which is an act ſo
difficult, and ſo remote from humane reaſon, that man might account it an
act altogether impoſſible. <hi>That God was able</hi>] He reaſoned and
concluded of Gods power only, becauſe he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of his
will, ſeeing he had received the promiſes of God, wherein God had
ſufficiently declared his will. The only doubt therefore reſted upon Gods
power, which doubt he ſolves by his faith. <hi>From whence alſo he received
him in a figure</hi>] Abraham did not only beleeve that God was both able and
willing to raiſe Iſaac from the dead, but in a manner ſaw him raiſed
from the dead, and in a manner received him againe from God as raiſed from
death. <hi>In a figure.</hi>] In the Greeke it is in a parable, or in a
ſimilitude; In a figure is oppoſed to the proprietie and truth of the
thing. For truely and properly Iſaac was not raiſed nor received from the
dead, becauſe hee was not dead: but in a figure and in a manner, hee was both
raiſed and received. For Abraham accounted his Iſaac for dead; and
therefore ſeeing now hee remained alive, and beyond all hope was reſcued
from the ſtroke, which his father had aimed at his throat, it was in a manner
all one to Abraham, and all one to Iſaac, as if Iſaac had beene dead and
raiſed <pb n="271" facs="tcp:61860:141"/>againe from the dead. For hence wee uſe to
ſay of thoſe that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſome extreme danger, wherein they
were given for dead, that they are as it were revived and recovered from the
grave. Holy David many times makes ſuch expreſſions of himſelfe; and
Paul, when God had delivered him from an extreme danger, wherein hee wholly
deſpaired of life, ſaith, <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our
ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but God which raiſeth
the dead, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver; in whom
we truſt; that he will yet deliver.</hi> 2. Cor. 1.9,10.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>By faith Iſaac bleſſed Iacob and Eſau
concerning things to come.</hi>] Now the Author mentions the peculiar faith of
Iſaac with an example of it; in bleſſing Jacob and Eſau concerning
things to come. He prayed to God for bleſſings to come upon them that
ſhould have their event, after many ages to come. For this bleſſing of
Iſaac was no ordinary or vulgar Benediction, as that of Parents commonly is;
who when they bleſſe their children, expreſſe only the wiſhes and
deſires of their mind; but whether the bleſſing will ſucceed according
to their wiſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, they are no way certaine (although ſuch
bleſſings of theirs may proceed from ſome faith) but Iſaac ſo
bleſſed his ſonnes, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with God for the things for which
he prayed, as if in a manner he had ſimply foretold them, nothing doubting of
their event, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely perſwaded, that God would doe no otherwiſe
then as hee had wiſhed and prayed. For when he perceived his errour in the
perſon of his ſonnes, yet he ſaid, <hi>I have bleſſed him, yea, and
he ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>] Gen. 27.33. In which words he plainly
ſignified, that the bleſſing he had given was ſo confirmed, that hee
could not recall it. But the Authour names Jacob firſt, though Eſau was the
firſt-born, becauſe Iacob had the firſt and the beſt bleſſing,
albeit hee obtained it by a wile, God ſo diſpoſing the matter. For before
either of them were born, God uſing his owne freedome in beſtowing his
bleſſings upon whom he will, had appointed to preferre Jacob before Eſau,
the yonger before the elder. Therefore God ſuffered not Iſaac to beſtow
the beſt bleſſing upon Eſau, that neither the decree of God, nor the
bleſsing of Iſaac might faile: eſpecially ſeeing Eſau had already
voluntarily and freely ſold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his birth-right, which (as the Scripture
ſaith) he deſpiſed. We ſay he ſold it voluntarily and freely,
becauſe he was not driven to that ſale by any deſtiny or decree of God.
For Eſau might have kept the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and benefit of his birth-right, and yet
as God had decreed, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie might have become yonger, or ſubject to
have ſerved the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of Jacob.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>By faith Iacob when he was a dying, bleſſed
both the ſonnes of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi>] Now he mentions the particular faith of
Jacob, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this bleſsing of the ſonnes of Joſeph. And he
addeth the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, that Iacob did this when he was a dying,
that hence it <pb n="272" facs="tcp:61860:142"/>might appeare, how hee perſiſted in the
faith to his laſt breath, and how conſtantly hee beleeved the promiſes of
God, whereby God had ſetled his bleſſing and the poſſeſſion of
the land of Canaan upon his poſterity. The Hiſtory hereof is in Geneſis
48. But wee may wonder, why the Author mentions onely the ſonnes of
Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, ſeeing with the very ſame faith Jacob gave bleſſings to all
his children, was it becauſe he ſhewed a particular faith, in beleeving
that Ephraim though the younger, ſhould be afterward preferred before
Manaſſes the elder, and therefore croſſing his hands otherwiſe then
Joſeph expected and had placed his ſons, laid his right hand upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
who ſtood at his left hand, and his left hand upon Manaſſes who ſtood
at his right? Or was it, becauſe he beleeved that theſe ſons of Joſeph
ſhould be accounted as his, and be adopted into the number of the twelve
Patriarchs, to give name and be heads to two of the Tribes? <hi>And
worſhipped</hi>] Here is mentioned another argument or proofe of Jacobs
faith, in that he worſhipped God, after that he had bound Joſeph, to carry
his body after his death into the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, as we reade it, Gen 47. For
by this worſhipping he declared that he wholly confided in God, who had
promiſed that land to his poſterity, and would in due time give them the
poſſeſſion of it. <hi>Vpon the top of his ſtaffe</hi>] The vulgar
Latin renders this perverſly, that he worſhipped the top of his ſtaffe.
As if Jacob had worſhipped the Scepter of his ſon Joſeph, that is,
Joſeph himſelfe, by reaſon of the high office and power that Joſeph had
in Egypt. Which interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither agrees to the words of the text, in
leaving out the particle <hi>upon;</hi> nor to the ſcope of the Author. For
what makes this to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Jacobs faith? nay the thing it ſelfe
ſcemes no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. The end is the extreme part of a thing: but if one
end of a thing be the higheſt, and the other the loweſt, the higheſt end
is the top. Which ſence muſt be here underſtood, as partly appeares by
the thing it ſelfe, and partly by the Hebrew word, Gen. 47. In the Hebrew for
<hi>top</hi> we reade <hi>head,</hi> which by a metaphor ſignifies the top,
becauſe the head is the end and higheſt part of man, and conſequently of
any thing elſe. And for <hi>ſtaffe</hi> we now reade in the Hebrew,
<hi>bed;</hi> which fell out becauſe the word Mittah, there extant, pricked
with other vowels, ſignifies a ſtaffe; for in the Hebrew Matteh is a
ſtaffe, and Mittch a bed. The Septuagint whom our Author followes, reade it
Matteh, and ſo tranſlated it <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> otherwiſe then we now
reade it in the Hebrew text. Both theſe readings have a commodious ſence.
For if wee give way to the authority of the Septuagint, the ſence will be,
that Jacob when by reaſon of his age and weakeneſſe he could not lift up
him ſelf by his owne ſtrength, ſtayed and raiſed himſelfe by the top
of his ſtaffe, the common ayde of old men, that he might worſhip God, by
bowing his body before him. But if we follow the Hebrew text, as it 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61860:142"/>is now extant, the ſence will be, That Jacob, becauſe
he could not raiſe his body out of his bed, therefore he bowed his head
forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his beds head, and ſo worſhipped God. For among the people of
God, it hath beene alwayes the manner of worſhipping God, by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
body, or at leaſt the head unto him.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>By faith Ioſeph when he dyed, made mention of
the departing of the children of Iſrael, and gave commandement concerning his
bones</hi>] Now he mentions the particular faith of Joſeph, who when he was
dying, mentioned the departure of the Iſraelites out of Egypt, and to
teſtifie his beliefe and aſſurance thereof, gave commandement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his bones, that when they departed out of Egypt toward the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed land,
they ſhould carry his bones with them. He gives comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement concerning his
bones, and not concerning his body, becauſe he knew for certaine, either by
the ſpirit of Propheſie, or elſe by the Oracle of God, as Abraham his
great grandfather did, that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſhould not very ſoone after
his death depart out of Egypt to take poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan
which God had promiſed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his death and their departure there
would paſſe ſuch a diſtance of time, that nothing of his body would
remaine beſides his bones. Which thing doth greatly commend the faith of
Joſeph, becauſe though he ſaw the performance of Gods promiſes deferred
for a long time yet to come, yet he neither deſpiſed them, nor doubted any
thing of their verity.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>By faith Moſes when he was borne, was hid three
months of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, becauſe they ſaw he was a proper childe.</hi>] The
Author being about to bring an example of the faith of Moſes, doth begin it
with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his parents faith; which appeared in their hiding of
Moſes when he was new borne. For hence it is manifeſt that they confided in
God, that by his helpe the childe ſhould be preſerved. And their motive to
this faith was, becauſe they ſaw the childe was comely or proper, that is,
ſuch a one in whoſe countenance there appeared an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and
excellent towardneſſe; and whoſe very aſpect ſeemed to preſage and
promiſe ſome great matter. In the ſeventh chapter of the Acts, ver. 20.
it is ſaid, that he was exceeding faire to God, which ſome Tranſlations
render by God; that is, his beauty came from God, or God in a ſingular manner
had made him very faire and beautifull. When therefore his parents ſaw him
ſo, they imagined that God would not have it be in vaine, that an Infant
ſhould be borne of ſo beautifull and comely countenance. And therefore they
doubted not but he ſhould be preſerved by the ſingular providence of God,
ſo as they alſo provided as much as lay in their power. And the event was
anſwerable to their faith. <hi>And they were not afraid of the Kings
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi>] King Pharoah by an Edict had commanded the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to
kill the male children borne of the Iſraelites, after that the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61860:143"/>who feared God, had refuſed to execute the like
command. This command of the King, the parents of Moſes feared not, becauſe
they feared not, but truſted upon God and his providence, that the child
which they had hidden, ſhould not be diſcovered and produced to be ſlaine
by the Kings command.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>By faith Moſes when he was come to yeares</hi>]
Here he begins to treat of Moſes his owne faith, and to mention the effects
of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is, that when he was come to yeares, he
<hi>refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharoahs daughter.</hi> Which fact of
Moſes he further illuſtrates and amplifies in the following verſes. In
the Greek for <hi>come to yeares,</hi> it is, when Moſes was become
<hi>great</hi> Which greatneſſe may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that dignity which
Moſes attained in Egypt, where he was bred up in the quality of the ſonne
of Pharoahs daughter. For he was learned in all the wiſdome of the Egyptians,
and was mighty in words and in deeds; as we reade it, Acts 7.22. But this
greatneſſe ſeemes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be referred to the ſtature of Moſes, and
conſequently to his age of mans eſtate; partly becauſe Moſes come to
yeares is here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Moſes when he was borne; and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ly becauſe the Scripture relating the
ſame fact of Moſes, ſaith that when he <hi>was growne up</hi> he went out
unto his brethren, Exod. 2.11. Or as Stephen

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>When he was full forty
yeares old, it came into his heart to viſit his brethren, the children of
Iſrael,</hi> Acts 7.23. This fact of Moſes in refuſing to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the
ſon of the Kings daughter, was a hardy attempt; not onely to deſpiſe and
reject ſo great a dignity, ſuch riches and pleaſures, but alſo thereby
freely to caſt himſelfe into that great calamity, under which the people of
God then ſuffered in Egypt. Therefore the Author wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling further to
illuſtrate and more amply to deſcribe this notable fact
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Moſes, doth adde in the
verſe following.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the
people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon.</hi>
The riches and dignity which Moſes did poſſeſſe with ſin, that is,
with the deniall of Gods people, and ſo of God himſelfe, (for otherwiſe
enjoy them he could not) he thought to be but a temporary uſe of ſinne; and
he therefore thought ſo, either becauſe he ſaw how tranſitory and
fading theſe things are; or elſe becauſe he thought, that God who is the
avenger of ſinne, would not ſuffer him long to enjoy thoſe riches and
dignities together with ſuch a wickedneſſe, and that ſome vengeance of
God, would ſuddainely ſtrip him of all his riches and power, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

ſin.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater
riches then the treaſures of Egypt</hi>] The Author proceeds yet, further to
illuſtrate and amplifie this fact of Moſes. But ſeeing by <hi>the
reproach of Chriſt</hi> is ſignified that calamity whereinto Moſes caſt
himſelfe and which he eſteemed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riches then the treaſures of
Egypt, there muſt needs be ſome trope <pb n="275" facs="tcp:61860:143"/>in thoſe
words. For properly the Reproach of Chriſt is that which Chriſt himſelfe
ſuffereth. But by way of Metaphor, it may ſignifie a Reproach like unto
that which was ſometime ſuffered by Chriſt or his people, who are
ſometime tearmed by the name of Chriſt: or the Reproach which he ſuffers
who bears the type of Chriſt or his people. Such was the Reproach of the
Iſraelites in Egypt, that is, their extreme affliction and oppreſſion
joyned with much ſhame and diſgrace. Now Moſes would rather become a
partner of this calamity, by profeſſing himſelfe an Iſraelite, then to
poſſeſſe the treaſures of Egypt. For whereas ſome imagine, that
Moſes is ſaid in this place to have ſuffered for Chriſts ſake, this
is a fond conceit. As if Pharaoh had ever thought of Chriſt, or had therefore
perſecuted Moſes, becauſe hee profeſſed himſelfe a Chriſtian, and
not rather an Iſraelite. Yet wee are to take notice, that this metaphor here,
either in both the words joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely, <hi>the reproach of
Chriſt</hi>] or in the ſingle word of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo as Chriſt
in this place may be taken for the type or image of Chriſt. And Chriſt
whoſe type and image is here ſignified, will bee either Chriſt
himſelfe, or the people of Chriſt, who as we have ſaid, are ſometime
noted and included in the name of Chriſt, as 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>So alſo is
Chriſt,</hi> and Gal. 3.16. <hi>and to thy ſeed which is Chriſt.</hi> In
which places it is moſt certaine, that by the name of Chriſt is ſignified
the people of Chriſt joyntly with Chriſt their head. But that people of
Iſrael were a type of both theſe, both of Chriſt himſelfe and of all
Chriſtian people. For hence it is, that in a myſticall ſenſe, that is
refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Chriſt, which in a literall ſenſe was ſpoken of the
Iſraelites, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son</hi>] Hoſ. 11.1. and Mat.
2 15. Therefore this people of Iſrael in bearing this type both of Chriſt
&amp; Chriſtians, might very fitly by this Author be called Chriſt. But as
we ſaid, there may be a Metaphor in both the words conjoyned, <hi>the
Reproach of Chriſt;</hi> and ſo the reproach of the Iſraelites in Egypt
may be called the <hi>reproach of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe in like manner it
beares a type and image of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach both of Chriſt and of Chriſtians,
by reaſon of Chriſt. For ſo the Author was pleaſed to ſpeak, that he
might ſpeak with reference to the afflictions of Chriſtians, who muſt
properly and truly beare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt for the hope of an exceeding
reward from God: which phraſe the Author uſeth afterward, Chap. 13.13. For
compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons and alluſions as we have often noted, are ſubject to many
abuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or improprieties. <hi>For hee had reſpect unto the recompence of
the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>] Here he ſhews the cauſe and ground from whence the faith
of Moſes grew, was one or both the principles of faith mentioned in the
firſt verſe: he had an evidence or ſight of ſomething unſeen; he
ſaw the unſeen recompence of reward, which God would beſtow on him, for
his eſteem of the Reproach of Chriſt; and he had a ſubſiſtence of a
thing hoped for, in that he hoped for the recompence of reward; which 
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61860:144"/>ſight and hope compoſed and framed his faith, and are
both ſignified in the word <hi>reſpect,</hi> whereby he both ſaw and
hoped for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward. And his faith built upon theſe two
grounds made him doe and ſuffer hard things for Gods ſake from whom he
expected his reward; for ſuch is the generall nature of faith to encourage
and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us under hard and heavy attempts.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>By faith he forſooke Egipt, not fearing the
wrath of the King</hi>] He mentions here another effect of the faith of
Moſes. And this may bee underſtood, firſt of that flight of Moſes out
of Egypt, after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelfe an Iſraelite, not only in
words, but by the ſlaughter of an Egyptian doing wrong to an Iſraelite,
Exod. 2,15. In which flight eſpecially the faith of Moſes appeared,
becauſe by his flight he hoped, that by Gods helpe he ſhould eſcape, and
that the wrath of ſo great and ſo potent a King, who as one ſaid truly,
have long hands, ſhould not hurt him having avoyded the danger by flying; and
being at a great diſtance out of the Kings reach, he feared not the wrath of
the King; for ſo only wee muſt underſtand his not fearing of the Kings
wrath. For otherwiſe in the forecited place of Exod. 2.14. it is written that
Moſes did feare, and becauſe he feared, therefore he fled. But after that,
when he was fled, then he feared not. <hi>For he endured as ſeeing him who is
inviſible.</hi>] Here he more fully declares the faith of Moſes, and to
ſhew the perfection of it, doth explicate both the effect and the cauſe of
it. The effect of it was, that thereby he <hi>endured;</hi> that is, hee
voluntarily underwent a grievous baniſhment, and conſtantly bore it, and
cared not ſo much to be reconciled to the King, as to live in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
deſpoyled of all his former dignity, though hee could no where ſubſiſt
ſafe or ſecure. And the cauſe of his faith was, his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or ſight
of a perſon unſeen, for he ſaw God who is inviſible, which ſight
built up his faith in God. Yet this whole verſe may bee referred to that fact
of Moſes, when returning by Gods command from his flight and baniſhment
into Egypt, and doing there ſo many ſtrange miracles, that the King
maſtered with divers plagues and at laſt hardly diſmiſſing the
people, he departed out of Egypt with all the Iſraelites as their Leader and
Captaine; which act he did by faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feared not, that the King
incenſed with wrath, as is uſually done in the like caſe, ſhould
collect all his forces, and purſuing him and the people ſhould aſſault
them by force of armes, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe with war and
ſlaughter, whom before he could not keepe in bondage. And this will be the
more fitly done, if we referre it to his purpoſe and preparation for his
departure out of Egypt with the people. For in the verſe following the Author
mentions the keeping of the Paſſeover, which preceded the departure of the
Iſraelites from Egypt. And it is very probable that the Author obſerved the
order of time. <hi>He endured;</hi> that is, he was not diſcouraged at the
troubles <pb n="277" facs="tcp:61860:144"/>and croſſes which hindred the departure of
the people out of Egypt, partly by the offence of ſo great a King, and partly
by the complaints of the people, who were thereupon the more oppreſſed. For
to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure doth properly ſignifie perſeverance and conſtancie in matters
of difficulty and trouble. All this he performed with ſuch a courage of minde
as if before his eyes he had ſeen that God who cannot be ſeene; that is, as
we have ſaid, ſo fully confiding in God, that neither doubted the
aſſiſtance of God, nor the ſucceſſe of the action.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>Through faith he kept the Paſſeover and the
ſprinkling of bloud</hi>] Another proofe of the faith of Moſes, in
performing and keeping the Paſſeover. For to what end and purpoſe did he
this, but becauſe hee was moſt certaine, by his reſt upon the promiſe
of God, that by this meanes all the firſt-borne of Iſrael ſhould be
preſerved from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which ſhould fall upon the firſt-born
of Egypt. The ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of bloud, was done by the bloud of the Lambe
ſlaine for the Paſſeover, which being taken in a baſon, and a bunch of
hyſop dipped in it, was ſprinkled upon the lintell and the two
ſide-poſts of the doors to thoſe houſes where the Paſſeover was
eaten: whereof ſee Exod. 12.13.33. <hi>Leſt he that deſtroyed the
firſt-borne, ſhould touch them.</hi>] The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer was that Angell of
God, who by Gods command was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in one night all the firſt-borne
of Egypt throughout their ſingle houſes. For although in the 12. Chap. of
Exod. it be ſeverall times ſaid, that the Lord would paſſe over the
land of Egypt and deſtroy the firſt-borne; yet in the ſame Chap. ver. 23.
God is manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that deſtroyer; whereby it
appears that God brought this deſtruction upon Egypt by the Miniſterie and
ſervice of an Angell.</p>
               <p n="29">29. <hi>By faith they paſſed through the Red ſea,
as by dry land</hi>] Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Author hath produced examples of faith from
ſingle perſons onely: but now he would ſhew the effects and fruits of
faith in a more popular and publique conſideration, as it may be ſeated in
the Church or people of God; yet not univerſally ſo as no ſingle perſon
ſhould have no defect of faith; but generally for the moſt part, or major
part. And although of the faith here mentioned, the Author ſpeake
imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, <hi>they paſſed</hi>] not naming who they were; yet the
context doth clearly ſhew us, that the imperſonall <hi>they</hi> muſt be
referred to the perſons of Moſes and the Iſraelites; becauſe they only
were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that paſſed through the red Sea. So the faith here
ſpecified was ſeated in Moſes, yet not in him ſingly and excluſively,
but in Moſes joyntly with the Iſraelites, or people of God, whoſe faith
herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the faith of Moſes: though therein the faith of
Moſes was ſingularly eminent; for he ſmote the waters ſo faithfully
with his rod, that upon the ſtroake they were divided; and he was the leader
and perſwader of the people to their paſſage. But the faith of the people
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61860:145"/>was but generall for the moſt or major part; for ſome
of them did hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or very weakly beleeve. Of this publike or common faith the
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mentions two effects; whereof the firſt is, the paſſage of the
Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>through the red Sea, as by dry land</hi>] That arme of the
Sea, which they paſſed, is in the Hebrew called <hi>Suph,</hi> that is the
Ruſhie ſea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Bul-ruſhes therein abounding: but why among
other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is called the red ſea, Interpreters agree not; whether it
be from the redneſſe of the water, or the redneſſe of the ſand, both
by the ſhore and in the deepe. or from king Erytha, whoſe name ſignifies
<hi>red,</hi> and ſometime poſſeſſed that Sea: neither is the
knowledge of the thing any way materiall. This Sea, the waters of it being
divided on each hand, they paſſed as by <hi>dry land.</hi>] The word
<hi>land</hi> is not in the Greek, but muſt be underſtood according to the
Hebrew phraſe uſuall amongſt them; as it is in divers paſſages of the
Pſalmes, and Mat. 23.15. The cauſes of this their faith was, their evidence
or ſight of a thing unſeen, and their ſubſiſtence of a thing hoped
for; for God had promiſed them a paſſage thorow the middeſt of this
Sea, as ſafe as on dry ground. Exod. 14.15,16. The truth of this promiſe
being unſeen, they ſaw and hoped for, and therefore they beleeved it.
<hi>Which the Egyptians aſſaying to do were drowned.</hi>] The other effect
of their faith upon the Egyptians; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an effect of defect of faith in
the Egyptians; who having in them no true faith at all, but preſumption
enough and too much raſhneſſe, would needs imitate the fact of Gods
faithfull people, and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption aſſaying to paſſe the red
Sea, as the faithfull had done before them, were therein drowned. And that fact
which to the faithfull was a meanes of their ſalvation, was deſtruction to
unbeleevers, who would ſeeme to be faithfull. For the drowning of the
Egyptians in that Sea, was an effect of the Iſraelites faith; becauſe they
had a ſight of it unſeen; for God had promiſed the Iſraelites upon
their paſſage thorow the red Sea, not only ſalvation to themſelves, but
deſtruction to the Egyptians, whom they ſhould never ſee more. Exod.
14.13. For hereby the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſaw that deſtruction of the Egyptians
which was not yet ſeene, and therefore did beleeve the truth of it, whereupon
followed the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it.</p>
               <p n="30">30. <hi>By faith the walles of Iericho fell downe, after
they were compaſſed about ſeven dayes.</hi>] Having amply exemplified the
faith of Moſes, who was the firſt Captaine over Gods people to bring them
out of Egypt: now he ſeconds Moſes with the faith of Joſhua, who was the
ſecond Captaine of that people, to give them entrance and poſſeſſion
in the land of Canaan: yet this is ſo intended of Joſhua, as the people
alſo are joyned in faith with him; for they alſo did partake both in the
action and benefit of this faith. The action or fact of this faith was, the
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsing about of Iericho ſeven dayes.</hi>] Jericho was a fortified
towne, ſo ſtrongly defended or ſhut up, as the Scripture termes it, that
it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, <pb n="279" facs="tcp:61860:145"/>and the Iſraelites had no hope to
take it by aſſault: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a frontier towne to the land of
Canaan, therefore unleſſe they firſt take Jericho, they can have no
paſſage to march further into the land of Canaan, but are there wholly
intercepted and ſtopped from all entrance into the land promiſed. Jericho
therefore muſt needs firſt be taken: and becauſe it cannot be conquered
by force of armes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be taken by force of faith, <hi>after
compaſsing about the walles of it ſeven dayes.</hi>] God who is ſo
powerfull that hee could create the world in ſix dayes, could have
deſtroyed. Jericho in leſſe then ſeven: yet God who is ſo mercifull,
that hee gave the great City of Ninivie fourtie dayes, would give little
Jericho ſeven dayes; for God who ſent Jonas to them of Ninivie, had
provided Rahab for them of Jericho, as a Prophet and a Preacher of repentance
unto them. For ſhe who for her ſelfe had ſuch faith to beleeve in God,
would gladly have preached the like faith to the Citie, that God who is the God
in heaven above and in earth beneath, had given that land to his owne people,
as ſhee her ſelfe had before acknowledged to the ſpies of Iſrael.
Joſh. 2.9 11. But becauſe they of Jericho were ſo wicked, that ſhee
durſt not preach this faith among them, and ſo obſtinate, that if ſhee
had preached it, yet they would not beleeve it, therefore by the faith of Gods
people, after ſeven dayes compaſſing, the walles of Jericho ſhall fall
downe. Now the cauſe of this faith in the people of God, was their evidence
or ſight of things unſeen, and the ſubſiſtence they had of a thing
hoped for; for God had promiſed them by the mouth of Joſhua, that upon this
fact of compaſſing the Citie ſeven dayes once a day, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day ſeven times, the wall of it ſhould fall downe flat. Joſh. 6.4,5. The
truth of this promiſe being yet unſeen, they ſaw and hoped for, and
thereby grew their faith to beleeve it.</p>
               <p n="31">31. <hi>By faith the harlot Rahab</hi>] There are that
thinke that Rahab was not an harlot, but an Inkeeper, or Taverner; which
becauſe they are wont ſometimes to be harlots, or to receive harlots that
frequent their houſes, therefore among the Hebrews, the name of harlot is
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to hoſteſſes. But this ſignification of the Hebrew word
<hi>Hazzonah</hi> they prove not by examples. Neither is it for nothing, that
the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture whenſoever ſhe mentions the example of Rahab, to whom God
ſhewed ſo much favour and mercy, forgets not to give her this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of
harlot. For it ſeemes to doe this, thereby to ſhew, the great force of a
true and lively faith, becauſe by vertue thereof, many attaine to
juſtification and impunity, who otherwiſe by their life little deſerve
it. Now if the Hebrew word <hi>Hazzonah</hi> ſignified onely a publike
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſſe, when it is uttered of Rahab, and not an harlot properly ſo
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, this ſingular commendation of Rahabs faith were utterly loſt-which
notwithſtanding James and this Author endeavour to expreſſe.
<hi>Periſhed not with them that beleeved not</hi>] The inhabitants of Jericho
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61860:146"/>are called unbeleevers, becauſe they would not beleeve,
that the God of heaven had granted to the Iſraelites the poſſeſſion
both of their city and of the whole land of Canaan, or becauſe beleeving this
grant of God yet they would not obey it, by giving way to it; for the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies as well unobedient
as unbeleeving. And they were diſobedient, becauſe they would not admit but
oppoſed the people of God, whom they knew were approaching, and had heard
what ſtrange works God had done for them, and conſequently would not
ſubmit to Gods way. For if herein they had joyned with Rahab, to have
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved as ſhe did, they might with her have eſcaped the deſtruction of
their City and their owne ruine. For that Law of God which had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſo
many Nations to the ſlaughter, was by collating it with another Law to be
underſtood to take place, with the exception of thoſe that ſhould freely
ſubmit to things commanded them, and ſhould renounce the worſhip of their
Idols and falſe gods. All which appeares by the example of Rahab and of
Solomon who tooke the remnant of the Canaanites to his dominion under tribute,
1 King. 9.20,21. <hi>When ſhe had received the ſpies with peace</hi>] She
abſtained from all injury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe ſpies her ſelfe, and from all
treachery in diſcovering them to others, and defended them from the violence
of thoſe that made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition after them: For theſe were the
expreſſions of that peace wherewith ſhe received them. And this her faith
was not idle and empty, but teſtified with a notable action of triall. For
ſhe did not onely receive thoſe ſpies with the danger of her life, but
ſhe hid them, and afterward diſmiſſed them with many difficulties.
Which fact of hers, how availeable it was to her juſtification, both the
thing it ſelfe declares, and S. James openly teſtifies, Jam. 2.25.
<hi>Likewiſe alſo was not Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes when
ſhee had received the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and had ſent them out another
way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32. <hi>And what ſhall I more ſay?</hi>] As if he had
ſaid; Why ſhould I ſtay longer in relating of ſingle examples of
thoſe whoſe faith is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Scripture? For the time would faile me
to tell of Gedeon, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac, Samſon, and of Jephte, of David alſo, and
Samuel, and of the Prophets. Hee placeth David, though latter in time before
Samuel though elder, not onely for the greater dignity of David, but alſo
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Samuel came neerer in quality to the Prophets with whom he
cloſeth; And David came neerer to thoſe Heroes forenamed, as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon, Barac
and Samſon; for he was a middle perſon betweene the Heroes and the
Prophets, and was indeed both.</p>
               <p n="33">33. <hi>Who through faith ſubdued kingdomes.</hi>] This
is principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to David who ſubdued ſome kingdomes. But this was
done by faith, becauſe when God promiſed him victory over his enemies, he
beleeved it, and upon his beliefe thereof did make warre upon them; whereof we
may reade ſeverall Pſalmes of David, compoſed by him 
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61860:146"/>to that purpoſe; and among others, Pſal. 2.18.20. and
21. <hi>Wrought righteouſneſſe</hi>] Such were alſo the ſame David,
Samuel and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Here in like manner it appeares, that faith taken
ſtrictly and properly differs from the working of righteouſneſſe, as
the cauſe from the effect; becauſe righteouſneſſe is the effect of an
effectuall faith. <hi>Obtained promiſes</hi>] Theſe ſeeme rather to
ſignifie, that by faith they obtained new and extraordinary promiſes;
ſuch as that promiſe made to David, that the Kingdome ſhould be ſetled
upon his poſterity for ever, and that Chriſt ſhould be borne from his
line; then that they obtained the effect of Gods ſolemne promiſes. For if
that effect be taken for immortall life, it is falſe, as it is taught
afterward, ver. 39. But if we take it of the bleſſings of this life, they
ſcarce ſeem any other, then victories and triumphs over their enemies. But
theſe are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly related in the verſe following: unleſſe we
ſay that thoſe promiſes which they obtained are ſpecified and reckoned
up in the verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and ſo after he had ſaid, that by faith they
wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, he rightly addes, they alſo obtained the
promiſes, namely thoſe which preſently he would ſpecifie in particular,
even unto thoſe words of verſe 35. <hi>Others were tortured</hi>] And ſo
as from thence it followeth; where after he had reckoned up divers calamities
which the ſervitors of God ſupported by their faith in God, had endured, at
laſt, he addes, that they received not the promiſe. It may ſeem
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author would ſay, that ſome by their faith obtained the
effect of Gods promiſes, as namely they before mentioned, who in this life
attained thoſe great benefits of God which he reckoned up: but others
afterward mentioned, though they had no leſſe faith in God then the former,
yet enjoyed not the performance of Gods promiſe, becauſe they were deprived
of their lives for their righteouſneſſe and faith in God. <hi>Stopped the
mouths of Lions</hi>] As Daniel did, the hiſtory whereof is extant, Dan.

               <p n="34">34. <hi>Quenched the violence of fire</hi>] As thoſe
three young men, in Babylon, who ſeem in a manner to be accounted among the
Prophets, ſee Daniel 3. <hi>Eſcaped the edge of the ſword</hi>] As many
of the Prophets did, whoſe lives were attempted by the Kings and the people,
as Elias, Eliſha, Jeremy, Micheas. <hi>Out of weakneſſe were made
ſtrong</hi>] By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering from dangerous and deadly ſickneſſes, as
Ezechias, 2 King. 20. <hi>Waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the Armies
of the aliens</hi>] As Sampſon and David; though we may refer this valour,
not only to their courage of minde, but to their ſtrength of body. Of
Sampſon, ſee Judg. 14. and the Chapters following: Of David, Pſal.
18.35.37. &amp;c. And hither we may refer thoſe ſeverall Worthies of David,
of whom we read, 2 Sam. 23. and 1 Chron 11.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>Women received their dead raiſed to life

King. 17.19. &amp; 2 King. 4.21. <pb n="282" facs="tcp:61860:147"/>and in the latter of
theſe two miracles there was an acceſſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faith alſo.
<hi>And others were tortured</hi>] The word <hi>others</hi> doth ſhew that
the Author now ſpeaks of another ſort of perſons eminent alſo for their
faith: Namely, of ſuch whoſe faith was not conſpicuous for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories or
warlike exploits, which belong not ſo much to Chriſtians; nor for the
ſole workes of righteouſneſſe, or other notable gift of God, as their
faith was of whom he ſpake hitherto; but of a faith whereof tryall was made
in ſuffering perſecutions and grievous afflictions for God and
Righteouſneſſe ſake; which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Chriſtian Faith. For
of the ſame faith the effects are divers. The torture here mentioned is in
the Greeke <hi>tympanized;</hi> which is a torture whereby a man is diſtended
or ſtretched alive like a drum, and then beaten with cudgels as a drum is;
which kinde of torture is in uſe at this day among many Nations. And it was
inflicted upon Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer that reverend old man, in the time of Antiochus the
perſecuter, 2 Maccab. 6. For without doubt the Author in this place had
reſpect to thoſe times. Although ſome of the afflictions which hee
afterwards mentioneth, happened in the time of Elias under Ahab and Jeſabel;
ſee 1 King. 18.4.13. and Chap. 19.10. <hi>Not accepting deliverance</hi>]
When deliverance or releaſe from their tortures was offered them upon
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to renounce Gods Law, they would not accept it, ſee the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Eleazer, 2 Maccab. 6.19,30. for to thoſe words there, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſeems
to have relation here. <hi>That they might obtaine a better
reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>] He ſhews with what faith, and with what hope they
endured their tortures; namely, becauſe they beleeved and hoped, they
ſhould obtaine from God a farre better reſurrection. But whence did they
gain this faith and hope? Certainly, not from any open or clear promiſe of a
reſurrection, extant in the Law of God: but only truſting upon the ſole
goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe, and power of God. For ſeeing they did
ſtrongly beleeve, that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek
him; and yet ſaw, that unleſſe with extreme wickedneſſe they would
forſake the Law of God, they muſt ſuffer heavy calamities, as
baniſhment, impriſonment, tortures and cruell deaths; they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
raiſed into this hope, that there were rewards laid up for the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and
piety of Gods worſhippers to be received after this life; and that it could
not poſſibly be, that God who is moſt gracious and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ſhould
have no reward in ſtore for that vertue and piety which of all other is the
greateſt, &amp; doth coſt men the loſſe of their lives, then which
nothing can be dearer unto them. Thus therefore God, even under the Old
Teſtament, did with ſuch rudiments by little and little exerciſe his
people toward the hope of another life: although there can be no doubt, but
that the ſervitors of God were under thoſe hard and ſad times of
perſecution inſpired by the Spirit of God, and did thereby ſo much the
more taſte and ſwallow this hope in their ſoules. <pb n="283" facs="tcp:61860:147"/>Now if they, by hope of the future Reſurrection, whereof they had
no open promiſe of God, and knew not in any certainty the future quality and
bleſſedneſſe thereof, did ſuffer ſuch grievous calamities for their
conſtancie to Gods Law. How much more ſhould we, who have an open promiſe
of the reſurrection, and know both the future qualities of it, and the great
happineſſe that will accompany it, feare no terrors, no baniſhments, no
torments nor puniſhments for Chriſt and for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſake.
As it is uſuall in compariſons, he tacitly calls their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from
puniſhment, a reſurrection, by way of abuſion, while he oppoſeth it to
the true reſurrection as to a condition much better. Therefore they
deſpiſed deliverance, which was but an umbratilous and tranſitory
reſurrection, to obtaine the true reſurrection accompain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eternall
life and happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="36">36. <hi>And others had triall of cruell mockings and
ſcourgings</hi>] As the mother with her ſeven ſons, 2 Macab. 7. <hi>Yea,
moreover of bonds and impriſonments.</hi>] While Antiochus did rage in his
perſecution, there muſt needs be a great number of thoſe, who becauſe
they would not forſake the Law of their God, were caſt into bonds and
priſons; from whence a while after divers of them were drawne forth to divers
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhements, which are preſently mentioned.</p>
               <p n="37">37. <hi>They were ſtoned, they were ſawne aſunder,
were tempted, were ſlaine with the ſword</hi>] He recounts divers kinds of
puniſhments, which of old the worſhippers of God endured, truſting and
relying upon God; that by their example he might ſtir up the followers of
Chriſt to the like conſtancie in their ſufferings. <hi>Were tempted</hi>]
In the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſome

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they were burned. And indeed, if
this word were uſuall, there could ſeem no doubt of this reading; for it
might eaſily be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by changing the vowell into the dipthong, ſeeing
the ſenſe i very agreeable to the place. For here are recounted divers
kinds and means of death, as ſtones, ſawes, axes, ſwords, and among which
fire alſo may well be placed. But <hi>tempting</hi> ſeems not any of the
number. For <hi>temptation</hi> is a thing generall and common to all who
ſuffer perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for righteouſneſſe ſake. And withall
<hi>temptation</hi> doth imply the conſtancie of them who are tempted. But if
we muſt needs read it they <hi>were tempted,</hi> then we muſt underſtand
it of ſome particular kinde and forme of temptation, wherewith perſons in
diſtreſſe might eaſily bee overcome, and drawne from their
conſtancie; as for example, when a man is follicited to ſome fained act, or
to ſome ambiguous words, by promiſing him ſafety, and ſome good rewards
beſides, to condeſcend to this, that though he will not truly recede from
his former way, yet that he ſeem to recede from it. For after this manner we
read Eleazer was temped. Now for a man to overcome ſuch a temptation by
lending no care nor minde unto it, but rather dye a cruell death, then to
ſtaine <pb n="284" facs="tcp:61860:148"/>the reputation of his confeſſion and
conſtancie with the leaſt ſhew of diſſembling, is a great and a brave
conqueſt. <hi>They wandred about in ſheeps skins and goats skins</hi>] For
they had no means to procure other garment or covering for their body; and
therefore he preſently addes, <hi>being deſtitute, afflicted,
tormented.</hi> This is the reaſon, why they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred about, and why in
ſheeps skins, and goats skins, becauſe they were deſtitute of all worldly
proviſion, and in all places where they came were afflicted and tormented,
and therefore they wandred from place to place in that deſpicable and poore
manner. All which miſeries hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them in the times of the Maccabes
under the perſecution of the cruell Antiochus.</p>
               <p n="38">38. <hi>Of whom the world was not worthy: they wandred in
deſerts and in mountaines, and in dens and caves of the earth</hi>] The
Author inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the former words of this verſe, to ſhew the indignity
of the uſage and foulneſſe of the injury, which the wicked inflicted upon
the true ſervitors of God. As if he had ſaid, theſe good men were
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to wander like wilde beaſts, and to hide themſelves like
wilde beaſts in deſarts and mountaines, in holes and caves of the earth:
but among men in Townes and Cities, they could have no abode, though for their
piety and faith toward God, they were of ſuch worth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the
inhabitants of the whole world were unworthy of them. Of this carriage,
Chriſtians eſpecially ought to take notice, when they ſee worthy
perſons to be vexed, baniſhed, afflicted and ſlaughtered of the unworthy,
good men of evill, and the innocent of the wicked. For as the Author would
intimate unto us, it may be, that the world herein did in a manner puniſh her
ſelfe, in that ſhee perſecuted and baniſhed ſuch holy perſons, and
drave them away from her, of whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and company ſhe was
altogether unworthy.</p>
               <p n="39">39. <hi>And theſe all having obtained a good report
through faith, received not the promiſe</hi>] The word <hi>all</hi> ſeems
in the intention of the Author, to be chiefly referred to thoſe perſons
laſt mentioned, who for the love of Gods Law ſuffered ſuch great
calamities. For the former perſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before them, obtained ſome
promiſes of God as rewards of their faith: but theſe latter that were
perſecuted and ſlain for the teſtimony of Gods Law, had none. And yet,
all their faith who were mentioned in the former place, was not ſuch a faith,
as to be of it ſelf a ſaving faith, or ſuch an one, which could procure
them eternall life, which the Author here underſtands by the name of <hi>the
promiſe,</hi> unleſſe ſomething elſe were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, particularly that
faith which concerns only wars, or had ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing propoſed for
the matter of it, as the recovery of their health, or the raiſing of their
dead children to life, and which was perpetuall in them, working in them that
had it, true righteouſneſſe and piety; for there is no cogent reaſon
conſtraining us to affirme, that it was ſuch a faith: See what the Author
hath affirmed, ver. 33, 34, 35. <hi>A good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <pb n="285" facs="tcp:61860:148"/>part
through faith</hi>] They obtained the praiſe and commendation of their faith
in the Scriptures, See ver. 2. <hi>through faith</hi>] Partly becauſe their
faith was the cauſe, why they performed ſuch worthy acts, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
great praiſe and commendation. Partly, becauſe ſuch a notable faith in
God, was of it ſelfe the cauſe and matter of that good report and
commendation. <hi>Received not the promiſe.</hi>] The article <hi>the</hi>
doth ſhew, that ſome excellent promiſe is here deſigned out; namely,
that which is peculiar and proper unto Chriſtians, which hath none greater
and more excellent then it ſelfe; the promiſe I meane, of that truly
bleſſed and eternall life; which though it were not openly promiſed to
them, but only to us, yet it ſhall be given to them as well as to us. But the
word promiſe is taken here materially for the thing promiſed.</p>
               <p n="40">40. <hi>God having provided ſome better thing for
us</hi>] Hee addes here the cauſe why they have not yet received the
promiſe. For the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews might thinke, that God in this reſpect had not
dealt ſo well with them, that they had not yet received the reward of their
faith, workes and ſufferings. The Author therefore meets with ſuch
ſurmifes, and ſhews it was done for this reaſon, becauſe God had
provided ſome better thing for us. 
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A queſtion.</hi>
                  </note>But here it may
be demanded, wherein our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the better, in that they might not
receive that promiſe, nor bee perfected without us? For if they had received
eternall happineſſe before, would the ſumme of our happineſſe have
been any thing the leſſe? Or is our happineſſe any thing the greater,
becauſe they are made to ſtay for it? The Anſwer to this may be twofold,
and according to the twofold Anſwer, there will ariſe a twofold ſenſe
of theſe words. 
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1.</note>The firſt
Anſwer is, That God would herein provide for our dignity, and make our

ſelf, nothing would either be taken from our happines, if they had obtained
eternall life without us or before us; or will now accrue unto it, that they
have it not without us, but together with us; yet reſpectively and
comparatively, we ſhould have been far inferiour unto them, if they without
ſtaying for us, had been long ſince inveſted in heavenly joyes. But now,
ſeeing they are conſtrained to ſtay for us, and may not enjoy that
promiſe before us; hence appears, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of Chriſtians is very
great, and that their happineſſe is made much more conſpicuous; ſeeing
there are none who can ſeeme to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure it, by preventing it with a fuller
or more early happineſſe. And certainly very convenient it was, that God
ſhould ſo provide for it, that they who had obeyed him, only according to
the ordinances of Moſes, ſhould not prevent in happineſſe thoſe who
compoſe their lives and manners according to the perfect Law and diſcipline
of Chriſt; and that they who never had any open promiſe of eternall life,
ſhould enjoy that life before them, who had an open and cleare Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for
it. But rather, ſeeing by Gods goodneſſe they were to bee 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61860:149"/>made equall to Chriſtians in the reward of that
happines, ſhould in this be made inferiour to Chriſtians, in ſtaying for
them to receive Gods promiſes; and that as ſecondary gueſts, who were not
openly invited to the banquet, they ſhould have their acceſſe, by, and
with them, who were truely and firſt invited; and not enjoy thoſe heavenly
banquets ſo long a time before theſe. And therefore the words <hi>ſome
better thing</hi>] may be taken two wayes; either as our ſtate compared with
their ſtate, may be ſaid to be better; or as our preſent ſtate compared
with our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate may be ſaid better, if they had received Gods
promiſe long before us. But becauſe that in it ſelfe doth neither
increaſe our future happines, nor in like manner doth decreaſe their future
happines, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author ſeemes to ſay <hi>ſome better thing</hi>
to ſhew, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands ſome ſuch better thing, which onely in
ſome ſenſe and in ſome reſpect is better. For the word <hi>ſome
thing</hi> is often uſed in ſuch formes of ſpeech, to diminiſh the
ſignification, and detract ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from the proprietie of the word whereto
it is adjoyned. 
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2.</note>The other
anſwere which happily is more ſutable to the fenſe and words of the
Author, is this. The Author therefore ſpeakes thus, to intimate that the end
of the world is at hand, when the reward of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life ſhall be given to
the godly that beleeve in God; wherefore, if thoſe ancient worſhippers of
God had long ſince enjoyed it, wee that were not then in being might have
failed of it. Therefore leſt wee ſhould be excluded of it, God did deferre
both the end of the world, and the reward of his worſhippers; and by this
meanes provided ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for us, then otherwiſe ſhould have been,
if they who went before us, without ſtaying for us, while we were yet unborn,
had alone by themſelves attained eternall happineſſe. For the reaſons
why wee reſt not in the former ſenſe, are. 1. Becauſe by admitting that
ſenſe, it doth not ſufficiently appeare, how God hath truely and really
made our condition better by this, that they who went before us, were not long
ſince rewarded with eternall life, but are made to ſtay for our
ſalvation; whether our ſtate be compared with their ſtate, or with our
owne future ſtate. For certainely by this meanes our ſtate is not made
better then theirs, but onely each of our ſtates is made equall. Alſo how
is our preſent ſtate made hereby better then our future, if God had
otherwiſe determined it? For what was it, that God had appointed unto us? was
it not the reward of eternall life to be beſtowed upon us at the end of the
world, in the conſummation of this preſent age? but this remaines whole and
intire unto us, neither is it really decreaſed if we ſuppoſe them long
ſince ſaved: neither is it increaſed, if we ſuppoſe them not ſaved.
They loſe much by it, in that they yet enjoy not Gods promiſe of eternall
life; but what doe we really gaine by it? you will ſay, their condition would
have beene better, and ours worſe; which becauſe now it is not worſe, but
equall to theirs, therefore it may <pb n="287" facs="tcp:61860:149"/>be ſaid to be better
now then otherwiſe it would have beene. But all this is rather ſubtiltie of
words, then ſolidity of matter. If this had been the intent of the Authors
minde, could he not, nay, muſt hee not have ſpoken much more clearly, thus?
that God therefore hath not yet given them the reward of eternall life, leſt
they ſhould bee farre ſuperiour unto us; and ſo much the rather,
becauſe it doth not forthwith follow, that our ſtate is therefore truely
better, becauſe it is not worſe then theirs. For this would indeed be true,
if nothing were abated them: but ſeeing all that portion of happineſſe
whereby they were ancienter then we, is abated them; certainly by this meanes
our happineſſe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, but theirs only ſomthing leſſe. And
the former ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the particle <hi>without</hi> in the words
of the Author, ſhould ſignifie all one with <hi>before,</hi> that is, not
to exclude us from perfecting ſimply, but onely from the ſame time of
perfecting. But if this were the minde of the Author, he might as eaſily have
ſaid <hi>before</hi> as <hi>without;</hi> yea, he ſhould have rather ſaid
it; ſeeing the uſuall force of the latter particle is ſimply to
ſeperate and exclude that, whereto it is adjoyned, who ſees not, if wee
reſpect the proper and native ſignification of the Authors words, that it
is all one as if he had ſaid, <hi>they ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected excluding
us,</hi> or <hi>we not being perfected?</hi> And howſoever the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>ſomething</hi> doth ſometime diminiſh the ſignification, yet the
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe in this place ſeemes to require, that it ſignifie no
ſmall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective good, but ſome ſingular advantage greatly
neceſſary to our condition, which is the uſuall force of that particle.
For ſuch a thing it muſt needs be, that was the cauſe, why ſuch holy
men, ſo deare unto God, and dead ſo many ages paſt, ſhould not to this
day enjoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, and receave the reward of their labours and
ſufferings. And in this argument, wherein we debate the cauſes, why God
ſhould for ſo many ages deferre the effect of his promiſe, what either
may, or can, or muſt be brought of greater moment, then that by this meanes,
God in the meane time hath exceedingly provided for us, who ſhould
otherwiſe have been excluded from that eternall happines, if the time
appointed for the <hi>perfecting</hi> of the godly, had been long ſince
expired? Piſcator a good Interpreter had ſeen this ſenſe, and rightly
explicated it, if hee had not referred the word <hi>promiſe</hi> to the
firſt comming of Chriſt upon earth, contrary to the minde and ſcope of
the Author, but had related it to the reward of eternall life as hee ought to
have done. Neither hath any man cauſe to object, that perſons yet unborne
are non-entities; and non-entities as wee ſay, have neither affections nor
conditions, and therefore nothing can be done to them either better or worſe,
nothing ordained or provided for their good or evill: or if all ſhould bee
continually borne, then wee muſt fall upon an infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and ſo
no time would bee fixed for the godly wherein to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their reward. We
therefore anſwer, that non-entities are of two <pb n="288" facs="tcp:61860:150"/>ſorts,
either ſuch as actually onely have not being, although afterward they ſhall
or may have it, or ſuch as neceſſarily neither have being, nor ever
ſhall or can have it. Of theſe latter nothing can be truly ſaid or
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: but of the former non-entities many things may and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are
ſaid, and their ſtate may ſundry wayes be better or worſe; for hence
both Philoſophers and Lawyers call them poſſibilities. So Chriſt ſaid
of his betrayer; <hi>It had beene good for that man, if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene
borne,</hi> Mat. 26.24. For when Judas was a non-entity or yet unborne: yet
even then he was a poſſibility and might be borne; but his non-entity had
beene better, if it had beene an impoſſibility, never to have beene borne.
So ſometime we call them happy, who were not borne in troubleſome and ſad
times; whereto alſo in a manner we may referre the words of Chriſt;
<hi>Behold the dayes are comming, in the which they ſhall ſay. Bleſſed
are the barren and the wombes that never bare, and the paps which never gave
ſuck,</hi> Luke 23.29. In like manner, they who by their death have prevented
ſome calamities by dying before they ſuffered under them, are in that
reſpect commonly called happy; becauſe they might have lived ſo long as
to have ſuffered them. And in this ſence a Philoſopher ſaid, That it
was beſt for a man not to be borne; and it was next to beſt, to dye
preſently after he was borne. Contrarily, wee often call them unhappy, who
dyed before they had brought their ſtate to ſome happy condition, or lived
not to ſee thoſe happy times that immediately ſucceeded their death.
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the number of theſe non-entities, they may be reckoned, who
though they were yet unborne, yet might have beene borne. Hence with very good
reaſon, as we may call thoſe unhappy who ſhall never be borne, but are
intercepted by the end of the world, and therefore ſhall never attaine that
heavenly and eternall happineſſe: ſo much more are we happy and
bleſſed, who are already borne becauſe by the providence and
goodneſſe of God the perfection of the godly is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to our times,
whereby there remaines to us a paſſage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to it. And to
compriſe the matter in a few words and anſwer briefly. In that decree of
God, whereby he is ſaid to have provided ſome better thing for us, who were
not yet borne, then it would have beene, if he had long ſince perfected the
godly, wee muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, neither as already borne, nor yet as to be
borne after infinite ages to come; but as they who might be borne, while yet
the end of the world was not for many ages to be deferred; and Gods decree
being paſſed, muſt be borne. Happy therefore we are by vertue of this
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; but otherwiſe wee ſhould have beene unhappy. <hi>Better for
us</hi>] that is, for us that are Chriſtians; for this muſt not be
reſtrained onely to the Hebrewes, to whom this Epiſtle was written: but
muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all men under the ſame covenant, namely to all
Chriſtians. Whence in a manner it appeares, that the former examples of
thoſe <pb n="289" facs="tcp:61860:150"/>who ſuffered ſuch various afflictions, belong
to the Jews under the old Covenant, and not to the Chriſtians under the new.
<hi>God having provided</hi>] Gods Decree is here ſignified. For the thing
here ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, depends onely from the decree and ordinance of God; as if he
had ſaid, God having procured; for to provide, is to procure. <hi>That they
without us ſhould not be made perfect</hi>] How variouſly the Author
uſeth the word <hi>perfecting</hi> in this Epiſtle may appeare from our
former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications: and here he takes it in a ſence different from all the
former. He ſaid in the laſt verſe preceding, that they received not the
promiſes; and now he iterates the very ſame thing, and ſaith in other
words, <hi>they are not made perfect.</hi> And therefore in this place to
receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to be made perfect, that is, finally to attaine
eternall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is all one thing. And in this ſence it
ſeemes he uſed this word of Chriſt, before chap. 5.9. where he oppoſed
Chriſt being made perfect, to Chriſt ſubject unto ſufferings. Now they
who do receive that promiſe of eternall life and happineſſe, are fitly
ſaid to be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; firſt, becauſe before they attaine it, whether
they are living or dead, they are many wayes imperfect; and ſecondly,
becauſe when they have attained it, they have filled up the meaſure of
their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and made it ſo abſolute, that it neither hath any
defect, neither can it receive any acceſſe, but is for ever finiſhed.</p>

an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Hebrewes, to be conſtant in the faith, eſpecially
not to be diſcouraged by reaſon of the afflictions which they ſuffered.
And this exhortation he inferres from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſpecified in the former
Chapter, and confirmes it with new arguments, for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement.
<hi>We alſo, q.d.</hi> Let not us ſhew out ſelves inferiour to them,
whoſe examples were formerly mentioned: but let us alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the
ſame things which they did. <hi>Are compaſſed about with ſo great a
cloud of witneſſes</hi>] The Author addes this, becauſe it is of great
force to ſtir us up unto the courſe and conflict of our faith. And in this
his exhortation, he uſeth an elegant allegory, drawne from the ſimily of a
race which was a thing then much in uſe. He brings us in, as it were upon a
ſpacious theater, whereunto a multitude of ſpectators are collected, which
having filled all the ſeates and roomes doth encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the runners
round about like a thick cloud: and he makes us to be runners, having the eyes
of ſuch a multitude of ſpectators upon us. And as anciently ſuch a
multitude of ſpectators did adde courage to the runners, and was a mighty
ſpur unto them to contend for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo alſo to us, ſo many
witneſſes, who have themſelves formerly laboured in the ſame race,
ſhould adde courage, that we might runne the race begun to the utmoſt of
our ſtrength and breath. He calls them witneſſes not only in alluſion
to the ſpectators at a race (as wee ſaid) who are a kinde of witneſſes
of their activity that run; but alſo and much rather, becauſe they
teſtifie of God, of his righteouſneſſe and goodneſſe, and all of
them with one voice, as it were, ſay, that God is, and is a rewarder of them
that ſeeke him; and that he as the ſupreme depoſitary keeps the prize for
them that run well; that he is moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his promiſes, and can
even after death make them happy, who have ſpent their life for his ſake.
For by witneſſes in this place wee muſt chiefly underſtand them, who
teſtifie Gods faithfulneſſe and goodneſſe with their bloud; and hence
are eminently called Martyrs, <hi>i.</hi> witneſſes. <hi>A cloud of
witneſſes</hi>] That is, a great multitude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which carry
the ſhew and bulke of a cloud. Hence God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe comparing the multitude
of our ſins to a cloud, ſaith, I have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out as a thick cloud thy
tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud thy ſinnes, Iſaiah 44.22. <hi>Let us
lay aſide every weight</hi>] Hee recedes not from his <pb n="291" facs="tcp:61860:151"/>ſimily propoſed. For they that will contend in the running of a
race, muſt free themſelves from all weights, and lighten themſelves as
much as they can. By <hi>weight</hi> in this ſpirituall race of faith, wee
muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the love of this life, and the care of things pertaining
to it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our ſoules are burdened and preſſed downeward to the
earth as it were with a great weight. <hi>And the ſinne which doth ſo
eaſily beſet us</hi>] He ſeemes to allude to long and looſe garment,
which unleſſe they be laid aſide, are a great hinderance to runners,
about whoſe legs ſuch garments doe eaſily wave and wrap themſelves. By
<hi>ſinne</hi> he ſeemes to meane all outward vicious acts, as before by
weight, he ſignified the inward vices of the ſoule. For vicious acts doe
eaſily inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon us in our race of faith, and greatly
retard us in our courſe begun, unleſſe we caſt off all our love to
ſin; for as often as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an actuall ſinne, ſo often we fall as it
were in our courſe of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>And let us runne with patience,
the race that is ſet before us</hi>] This race, is the courſe it ſelfe
wherein we ſtrive by running: for in the Greek it is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereby is ſignified all kinde
of ſtrife in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whether it be by running, wreſtling, hurling, or
any other way: but here he ſpeakes of running. Therefore to runne the race is
nothing elſe but to ſtrive by running; and by this ſtrife in running he
meanes eſpecially the ſtrife of our faith; which conſiſts in this, that
we never be caſt in our hope of Gods promiſes made by Chriſt,
eſpecially when wee are to doe or ſuffer ſome hard matter for Chriſts
ſake. To this ſtrife particularly Paul exhorts his Timothy, when he calls
upon him, to <hi>fight</hi> the good fight of faith, 1 Tim. 6.12. And the very
ſame is ſignified by this Author, when in the next verſe willing to
excite us to this ſtrife, and to ſtrengthen us for it, he requires us to
looke unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith. For this we muſt
therefore doe, leaſt we ſhould waver in our faith, fainting and failing
under it; for this is oppoſed to the ſtrife of faith, ver 3. This race is
ſaid to be ſet before us, namely by God and Chriſt, becauſe the price
or reward of eternall life is appointed us upon no other condition, but of our
running this race. And wee are commanded to runne <hi>with patience</hi>]
either becauſe without patience it is impoſſible to keepe our faith with
God: or rather becauſe this race or ſtrife of faith appeares and ſhewes
it ſelfe in nothing more, then in a conſtant ſuffering of adverſities,
in ſo much that he who with an invincible courage doth ſuffer all evils for
Gods ſake and Chriſt, is thereby truly ſaid to runne the race of faith,
things doth ſtrive with afflictions, and will not be conquered or foiled by
them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Looking unto Ieſus the author and finiſher of
the faith</hi>] Here hee ſhews, from whence eſpecially we muſt procure
courage and ſtrength for our race of faith and patience; and what ſhould
incite us to runne <pb n="292" facs="tcp:61860:152"/>ſtoutly, and beare all things
patiently for righteouſneſſe ſake? Namely, the example of the Captaine
of our faith, upon whom we muſt caſt and faſten the eyes of our minde;
conſidering ſeriouſly, both what he did and what he ſuffered; what a
race he ran, and what a prize hee obtained having finiſhed his courſe. But
he calls him not the Captain of faith ſimply, but <hi>of the faith,</hi>
adding the article <hi>the,</hi> to ſpecifie unto us ſome particular and
ſingular faith, which is denominated from him, and called the Chriſtian
faith, becauſe Chriſt was the Author and Captain of it; not only becauſe
he was the firſt that taught it, but alſo the firſt that performed it, or
the firſt that did run the race of it. And he is alſo called the finiſher
of our faith, becauſe as he was the firſt Author that began it, ſo he is
the finiſher thereof to bring it to an iſſue and put an end unto it; for
a thing is then finiſhed when it hath attained the proper end. In like
manner, our faith ſhall be finiſhed, when it is come to the iſſue of
it, whereby we attaine the ſalvation of our ſoules, which as Peter ſaith,
is the end of our faith, 1 Pet. 1.9. And this end is attained through Chriſt.
For the like reaſon it was, that this Author before Chap. 3. ver. 1. called
Chriſt Jeſus the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion. For the
appellation of Apoſtle, though it rather note that Chriſt was the firſt
teacher of our faith, then the firſt ſufferer for it; and contrarily the
appellation of the Captaine of our faith, which here the Author uſeth, notes
rather the latter then the former, yet both theſe appellations doe tacitly
include both. But Chriſt is our high Prieſt eſpecially therefore,
becauſe it is his office to procure the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſinnes, and the
eternall ſalvation of our ſoules: in which point (as we ſaid)
conſiſteth the finiſhing and ending of our faith. For to this preſent
purpoſe this appellation of Chriſt is very ſutable, and of great force to
ſtrengthen our minds and confirme them againſt all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For with
what face ſhould we forſake that faith, which hath ſo great a Captaine to
it, and hath him for the finiſher of it who is the Author of it? <hi>Who for
the joy that was ſet before him</hi>] Chriſt to obtain the joy that was
ſet before him, endured the croſſe, and counterpoiſed the paine of
death againſt the joy of eternall life. Hence it appears, that the joy of
heaven, cannot be gotten at any leſſe price then the croſſe, if need
require. And he ſaith this joy was ſet before Chriſt, in alluſion to
the prize that is propoſed to them that run in a race, or ſtrive at ſome
other game. By Joy he underſtands that ſupreme and heavenly happineſſe
which Chriſt attained; and he calls it joy from the adjunct of it, becauſe
it is accompanied with unſpeakable and perpetuall joy; and withall is
oppoſed to the paine of the Croſſe which he ſuffered. Of ſuch high
advantage it is for thee, to endure trouble and torment for a ſmall time,
that thereby thou maieſt attaine heavenly joyes and pleaſures for ever.
<hi>Endured the croſſe</hi>] The croſſe hath in it two things extremely
bitter; extreme paine and extreme ſhame: yet the ſhame of 
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61860:152"/>it, is to a noble ſpirit far more bitter then the paine
of it; and therefore the Author addes, <hi>Deſpiſing the ſhame</hi>] It
was a great ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the Sonne of God, who well knew the high
dignity of his perſon, after he had delivered ſo many gracious doctrines,
and wrought ſo many admirable miracles, after ſo great hope and expectation
rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of him, to be ſeized upon by hangmen, dragged to execution, nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to a croſſe, lifted up on high, to endure the faces and eyes of all men
upon him, and be ſet as a marke for the ſpears and darts of bitter tongues.
Yet Chriſt deſpiſed all this deſpite, all this ſhame and this
diſgrace, that for a momentany ſhame, be might attaine everlaſting glory,
and for a temporall paine on earth, eternall joy in heaven. <hi>And is ſet
downe at the right hand of the throne of God</hi>] This is added to ſhew,
that Chriſt was not fruſtrated of his hope, but that hee received a large
reward of his faith and patience. To teach us, that if we alſo follow him in
this race, we ſhall have the like iſſue of our faith and patience. But
the great dignity and glory to Chriſt, that is ſignified by his ſitting
at the right hand of Gods throne, is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, Chap. 1. ver. 3. From
this place and the other Chap. 8.1. it appears, that when Chriſt is ſaid to
ſit at the right hand of God; by Gods right hand is not underſtood his
power and ſtrength, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where it is; but in this phraſe by a ſimily
drawne from men, is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the place at Gods right hand is more
honourable then that at his left. For otherwiſe it were not rightly ſaid,
the right hand of the throne of God; becauſe a throne hath no hand nor is
ſuppoſed to have any, but only a right ſide of it. And many times in the
ſame ſenſe, Chriſt is ſaid to ſit in the plurall number at the
right hands of God, or his power. For when the power of God is underſtood, or
a right hand is attributed unto him by way of analogie, it is not called the
right hands of God in the plurall number, but his right hand in the ſingular.
But when the right or left place is ſignified, it is commonly expreſſed
plurally by right or left hands, though it be uttered in reſpect of one
perſon only; See Mat. 20.21. and Mat. 25.33,34 41.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For conſider him that endured ſuch
contradictions of ſinners againſt himſelfe, leſt ye be wearied and
faint in your mindes.</hi>] Hee expreſſeth the end and uſe of the example
of Chriſt, why wee ſhould diligently conſider it; becauſe we are to
make this uſe of it, that our mindes may not bee tired with adverſities and
afflictions, and ſo wee become wearied and faint in the courſe of our faith
and patience, which here by profeſſion of Chriſt we have begun to
runne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For ye have not reſiſted unto blood ſtriving
againſt ſinne.</hi>] He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them with a new argument, to an invincible
courage in bearing the afflictions which they ſuffered. For it ſeemes, he
would make them ſomwhat aſhamed, that ſeeing the miſeries wherewith
they were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were not ſo grievous, as that hitherto they had
drawne bloud from <pb n="294" facs="tcp:61860:153"/>them, yet they begun to fail in courage
and ſtrength, contrary to Gods expreſſe monition. Here alſo he alludes
to ſtrifes, yet ſuch as were by fencing or fighting, and not by running.
For ſinne would beat us from our conſtancy of faith and pietie toward God:
but among the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which come to be ſuffered of us for the love of
Chriſt, is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation or deniall of ſinne, againſt which we muſt
fight. In this fight therefore, while the combat is but upon our goods, our
credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the matter is not yet come to bloud; but when cruelty,
tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and death chargeth upon our bodies, then the buſineſſe is in
good earneſt, and the fight is in the heat. Theſe Hebrewes as it ſeems,
were not yet in danger of their lives for Chriſt: but their ſufferings were
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mockings, reproaches, and ſpoiling of their goods, as appeareth, chap.
10. ver. 33.34. The Authour therefore ſhewes what a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing it is,
to turne the backe and flie at the firſt skirmiſh, as it were, and entrance
of the fight. But when he brings in ſinne for their enemy with whom they are
to deale, he doth therein by a moſt effectuall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, encourage them to
an holy valour, leſt they ſhould fail in their combat with an enemy ſo
baſe and dangerous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And ye have forgotten the exhortation.</hi>]
<hi>And</hi> for <hi>and yet,</hi> by way of a particle adverſative. As if he
had ſaid. Though ye have not yet ſpent your life and bloud for the love of
Chriſt: yet the divine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or exhortation is ſlipt out of your
minde, wherein yee are commanded to receive the chaſtning of the Lord with a
ready minde, and to beare it patiently. And conſequently, yee have forgotten
your dutie contained in that exhortation. For the Authour doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them meerly for their memory that they had forgotten the words of that
exhortation: but for their negligence, in not performing the duty therein
commanded. We have ſaid elſwhere, that hee is ſaid to remember a perſon
or a matter, who hath a care of it: and therefore hee that hath not ſuch
care, though otherwiſe hee remember him in mind, doth forget him. This hath
place chiefly in commands, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and exhortations, which are not given
therefore, only to remaine in our memories; but they muſt ſo remain in our
memories, as that they be put in execution and actually performed. And when the
authoritie of the commander or admoniſher is ſo great, that it is not
likely, but that hee who doth but onely remember the command or monition, would
obey it with great reaſon, they may be ſaid to forget it, who though they
retaine it in a lively memory, yet obey it not. <hi>Which ſpeaketh unto you
as unto children</hi>] The Author commends this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the qualitie
of it, that it is very gentle and fatherly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it termes them children
to whom it is directed. For who but a froward and obſtinate perſon would
not give way to ſuch an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The exhortation is ſaid to
<hi>ſpeak</hi> by way of Metonymie, becauſe he that exhorteth ſpeaketh by
it, or rather becauſe it is the very ſpeech <pb n="295" facs="tcp:61860:153"/>of him
that exhorteth. Now the perſon who exhorteth, is openly Solomon, but
ſecretly God, by whoſe inſtinct Solomon uttered this. Pro. 3.11.
Therefore in this exhortation God himſelfe calleth us his children; from
whence it follows that we ſhould receive it readily, and obſerve it
diligently. <hi>My ſonne, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the
Lord.</hi>] When we make God himſelfe to ſpeak and not Solomon, then the
name or Nowne of the Lord, muſt bee ſuppoſed to be put for the Pronowne
my, after the Hebrew phraſe. To deſpiſe, or (as it is in the Hebrew) to
reject the chaſtning of the Lord, is nothing elſe but an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to bear it patiently, but to kick againſt it as againſt
a prick. By the chaſtning of the Lord, the Author underſtands the
afflictions, which the Hebrewes ſuffered for Chriſts ſake: becauſe many
times God is wont to uſe ſuch afflictions, not onely to make triall of men,
but to make men good, and to amend them by a fatherly correction. And wee
muſt conceive that this had then befallen thoſe Hebrewes. <hi>Nor faint
when thou art rebuked of him.</hi>] Another abuſe of Gods chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite
contrary to the former; and that is, to faint and ſinke downe under it. For
ſome when they are chaſtned of God, are of a ſtubborne and impatient
ſpirit: others are ſoft natured, or have no ſpirit at all; whence it
comes to paſſe, that being overcome with afflictions, they faint and
forſaking their truſt and hope in God, turne aſide from the pathes of
righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth</hi>] The
reaſon expreſſed in the exhortation it ſelfe, why we ſhould be
obedient unto it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe chaſtening is an effect and an argument of
Gods love toward us: And what proceeds from Gods love, muſt not be
deſpiſed or rejected, but be held in high eſteem; neither muſt it
deject our minds from faith and hope in God, but rather raiſe and encourage
us to receive it. But we muſt note, that chaſtiſement, that is, that
correction or puniſhment which God inflicts upon us for our amendment, is a
token and effect of Gods love; and not every puniſhment, which oftentimes is
laid on men for their deſtruction: for this is the effect of Gods wrath and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, againſt which David ſupplicates in the ſixth Pſalme.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this reaſon muſt be taken with a limitation; for God doth not
chaſtiſe every one whom he loves (if we take chaſtiſing not ſimply
for affliction, but for a puniſhment) but then onely when they deſerve
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing, as for the moſt part they doe. But it appears by the ſcope
and intent of the Author, that theſe words muſt be taken, as if it had been
ſaid, Whom the Lord loveth, he at laſt chaſtiſeth, or ſometime
chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Which ſentence is more fully expreſſed in the Hebrew
text, if wee looke upon the following words, as wee ſhall ſee preſently.
For otherwiſe we could not hence gather, that chaſtiſing is alwayes an
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and token of Gods love. For ſaving the truth of the words in the
text, a man may imagine, that whom God loveth, hee chaſtiſeth, 
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61860:154"/>but not converſly, that whom he chaſtiſeth he
loveth: ſo that it may be doubted, whether chaſtiſing proceed from Gods
love or hatred. Neither are theſe ſayings repugnant, <hi>Whom the Lord
loveth he chaſtiſeth; and whom he loveth not, he chaſtiſeth;</hi>
ſeeing God may chaſtiſe both theſe; unleſſe as we ſaid, we
underſtand the particle <hi>at laſt</hi> in the latter part of the former
ſaying; which in ſuch ſayings falles out very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. <hi>And
ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth</hi>] This is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of
the ſame ſaying. In the Hebrew it is, even as a father the ſon in whom he
delighteth; which is nothing elſe but the converſe of the former ſaying;
as if Solomon had ſaid, whom God loveth, he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth, and whom he
chaſtiſeth, he loveth. So that chaſtiſing is a moſt certain and
undoubted effect and token of Gods love. <hi>Whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, i.</hi> whom
God adopteth, acknowledgeth and accounteth for his Sonne. For God doth not
acknowledge all for ſonnes, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Sonnes of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>If ye endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as
with ſons.</hi>] From the former divine exhortation, the Author frames in a
manner a new argument, to excite them unto patience in ſuffering of
afflictions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then God dealeth with them as with ſonnes. Ye have
this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity by your patience, that God offers himſelfe unto you as unto
children, and he on his part performes the office of a Father; ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye
have God for your Father. And God delighteth in him whom he chaſtiſeth as a
father in his ſonne. For what ſonne is he whom the father chaſtiſeth
not? It is the office of the father to chaſtiſe the ſonne that
deſerveth it; and he alwayes doth it, unleſſe many and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
have overcome his patience; and there be ſomething that hee fears, more then
he blames.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>But if ye be without chaſtiſement</hi>] To be
without chaſtiſement in this verſe; is oppoſed to endure chaſtening
in the former verſe: whence it appears, that the word <hi>endure</hi> in the
former verſe doth not ſignifie the vertue of patience which is a duty
belonging to the godly; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſuffering or ſenſe of paine which
concernes their ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Hee ſhews on the other part,
illuſtrating the thing from the contrary, what an inconvenience it is for a
man to be without chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to receive no trouble nor evill from
God. And the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is this, that ſuch goe not for ſonnes, but are
reputed of God as baſtards and children of adultery, and changelings; which
of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences is to man the greateſt. We muſt therefore needs
chuſe one of theſe two, either to be acknowledged for the ſons of God,
and ſo undergoe chaſtiſement: or if we will not be chaſtiſed, we
muſt bee accounted baſtards. <hi>Whereof all are partakers</hi>] To be the
Son of God, and to be chaſtiſed (at leaſt as often as need requires) are
conditions ſo connexed and coupled between themſelves, that all the Sons of
God muſt needs undergoe this Law, all muſt needs feele their Fathers hand, 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61860:154"/>and be partakers of chaſtiſement. All muſt needs be
partakers hereof, yet not univerſally, but generally; becauſe there are few
ſons, or rather but one only, who deſerved not chaſtiſement, neither
had any need of it. And yet even he was exerciſed with hard conditions, not
that hee was partaker of chaſtiſement properly; that is, of puniſhment;
for what place could puniſhment have in him that was moſt innocent: but
that by his ſtripes and wounds we might be perfectly healed? Hence the
chaſtiſement of our peace, or that brought us true peace and happines, is
ſaid to have been upon him, Eſay 53.5. in which place, the word
chaſtiſement muſt by way of ſynecdoche be taken for affliction.
<hi>Then are ye baſtards, and not ſonnes.</hi>] Ye are not truly borne of
God, not ſuch whom God acknowledgeth for his ſonnes and children; but yee
are baſtards and changelings. For they are baſtards who goe for the
ſonnes of ſuch a man, yet indeed were not begotten of him; and ſuch are
not alwayes acknowledged of their carnall fathers; but our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Father
cannot be deceived, for he knowes all that are not borne of him, and
acknowledgeth them for none of his, and thereupon vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth not to
beſtow any fatherly care and chaſtiſement for the framing of their
manners and behaviour.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Further more we have had fathers of our fleſh,
which corrected us</hi>] He ſhews by another argument, which is yet of
affinity with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that we muſt endure Gods chaſtiſements, and
ſo endure them, that thereby we become corrected and amended; for ſuch as
do this, they only receive chaſtiſement as they ought. The fathers of our
fleſh are our carnall fathers, that begat us according to the fleſh, and
produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us into this carnall life; for they are oppoſed unto the Father of
ſpirits, as it preſently follows in this verſe. <hi>And we gave them
reverence</hi>] By the chaſtiſements of our carnall fathers we were often
made aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, both by the puniſhment and by the fault, and were aſhamed
of both. For chaſtiſement brings with it, not only paine but ſhame: But
if we referre this to our fathers, the ſenſe will be, that by their
chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we were ſo affected, as to reverence them, and for ſhame
and fear of them, durſt not offend againſt them. But if our carnall fathers
who were the authors of our carnall life only, could by their chaſtiſement
effect this in us; how much more convenient is it, that the chaſtiſement of
our ſpirituall Father ſhould produce in us the like effect? <hi>Shall wee
not much rather be in ſubjection unto the Father of ſpirits?</hi>] To be in
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is in this place, to receive and endure that chaſtiſement
which proceeds from God with a ready and patient minde; and thereupon to ſhew
our ſelves tractable and obedient unto him in all thoſe things for the
amendment whereof he chaſtiſed us. <hi>The Father of ſpirits</hi>] That
is God, who is oppoſed to the fathers of our fleſh; to ſhew us, how much
more it becomes us, to bee in ſubjection unto him, then unto theſe,
becauſe the ſpirit is far more noble and excellent then the fleſh. 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61860:155"/>For God is not therefore called the father of ſpirits,
and oppoſed to the fathers of our fleſh, as if we had received our ſpirit
onely whereby we live and underſtand from God, and our fleſh onely from our
parents; ſeeing God is no leſſe the Author and Creator of the one then of
the other. But by ſpirit is meant all that which pertaines to our ſpirit,
and makes us to be ſpirituall; for this we owe to no other perſon but to
our heavenly father. But he is called the father of ſpirits, becauſe he
hath begotten us according to the ſpirit, and he alone hath begotten all of
us. <hi>And live</hi>] Hee ſhews the fruit and end of our ſubjection, the
more to incite us thereto. And this fruit is eternall life, which to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
is truly to live. Whence oftentimes it is eminently called by the ſole name
of life.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>And they verily for a few dayes chaſtened us
after their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure</hi>] Becauſe he had ſaid we ſhould live, if
we would be in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Father of ſpirits, tacitly intimating,
that this effect would not follow upon our ſubjection to our carnall fathers;
therefore now he ſhews, what great difference there is, betweene the end and
ſcope whereat our carnall fathers ayme, as they are oppoſed to our
ſpirituall father, and in this reſpect are not ſubſervient unto him,
and that end which God propoſeth in the chaſtiſement of his children.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it alſo followes, that we ſhould farre more willingly ſubmit
our ſelves to endure the chaſtiſements of God then of them; in regard
they are intended for a farre greater good unto us, then the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our carnall fathers. <hi>For a few dayes,</hi> the good or benefit of their
chaſtiſement is of uſe unto us, but for a few dayes, that we may
paſſe over this life which is concluded within the compaſſe of a
ſhort time, the more conveniently and honeſtly. For the Author by theſe
words intends not to ſay, that the chaſtiſement of our fathers laſteth
not long: but paſſeth away together with our childhood and youth; for what
doth this make to the purpoſe? Muſt we therefore be rather the more in
ſubjection unto God, becauſe his chaſtiſement laſteth a long time or
through all our life? Beſides, the minde of the Author is to inculcate into
us, rather the ſhortneſſe of Gods chaſtiſement, then the length of
it; as we might perceive before, chap. 10. ver. 37. <hi>after their owne
pleaſure</hi>] They in their chaſtiſements of us did not alwayes ſeeke
our benefit, but were many times indulgent to their owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and
paſſions; or if in ſome meaſure they ſought our benefit, yet they did
not alwayes uſe a right judgement therein. They did therein as it ſeemed
good unto them, ſometime after our deſert, and ſometime after their owne
pleaſure; and oftentimes erred through miſ-affection or indiſcretion.
<hi>But he for our profit</hi>] But God is ſuch a father that when he
chaſteneth his children, he alwayes directs his eye to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and
profit; neither doth ever miſſe of his intent. <hi>That we might be
partakers of his holineſſe.</hi>] Here he ſpecifies in particular the
profit we <pb n="299" facs="tcp:61860:155"/>gaine from Gods chaſtiſement; that thereby
we are ſanctified in ſo great a meaſure as to partake of his
holineſſe; for the holineſſe thereby wrought in us, is in a manner
divine, reſembling the holineſſe of God. Wherein is alſo contained by
way of Metonymy the fruit of this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is everlaſting
happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent</hi>] He
ſeemes here to take away an objection. Some man might ſay, that all
chaſtiſement of it owne nature is unpleaſing and bitter; and therefore it
is an hard matter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it with patience. The Author confeſſeth this
to be true, in reſpect of ſome time, that chaſtiſement for the time
preſent, all the while the affliction of it laſteth, ſeemes not ſo
good, as indeed it is. <hi>Seemeth to be joyous</hi>] It doth not appeare or
ſeeme unto us to tend unto joy; or the preſent ſowreneſſe and
bitterneſſe of chaſtiſement, while the ſmart of it is upon us, doth
not ſeeme to us, of that quality, that it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and end in
great joy and pleaſure. <hi>But grievous.</hi>] It ſeemes to bring nothing
elſe unto us but ſmart and griefe; for all chaſtiſement brings griefe
or paine, elſe it ſhould not be chaſtiſement; for therefore we are
chaſtiſed, that the paine of the puniſhment might repell the luſt of
ſinne. <hi>Nevertheleſſe afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of
righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi>] The fruit of righteouſneſſe ſignifies the
fruit that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, by a genetive of the difference. And the
word <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> doth in this place ſignifie both the habit
of doing righteouſly, and by way of Metonymy, the effect or reward following
it, which is Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or the having of a right to life eternall: as in
the former verſe holineſſe ſignified, both holineſſe of manners,
and the happineſſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon it. And this fruit is called
<hi>peaceable,</hi> not only in reſpect of righteouſneſſe properly
taken, which brings us peace, that is, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: but in reſpect of our
juſtification to life eternall; becauſe that conſiſteth in true peace
which is our finall happineſſe, and brings it with it. In a ſence not
unlike, Paul ſaid, that bleſſed hope, Tit. 2.13. for hope is there taken
materially for the thing hoped, which is eternall life; which is called
bleſſed, becauſe it is bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe, and makes them
bleſſed who attain it. <hi>Vnto them which are exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi>]
He ſpecifies here the perſons to whom this peaceable fruit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crews, and
they are ſuch as are exerciſed by chaſtiſement; for chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is an exerciſe to godlineſſe and righteouſneſſe. And they are
ſaid to be exerciſed by chaſtiſement, who either ſimply have beene
agitated and afflicted with corrections, yet ſo as tacitly it muſt be
ſuppoſed, that the perſons thus exerciſed, did profit in the courſe
of vertue and piety as much as need required; or who by their chaſtiſements
unlearned to do evill, and whoſe minde by that meanes was framed to every
good habit of well-doing; ſo that withall is alſo ſignified the effect of
that chaſtiſement, together with the perſons profited by it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Wherefore lift up the hands which hang
downe</hi>] After the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <pb n="300" facs="tcp:61860:156"/>had ſhewed the great
profit which wee receive by the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; he from thence
inferres an exhortation, that therefore we ſhould not let fall our ſpirits,
but rather raiſe them up, and with all alacrity proceed in the worke and
courſe of Chriſtian piety. Hee tearmes their hands hanging downe, becauſe
they had beene remiſſe in the works of Chriſtian duties, being tired as
it were with diverſe afflictions. He would therefore have them, not yeild to
afflictions, but raiſe up their courage and ſtoutly go on in their works
began of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety; conſidering they ſaw that their afflictions
proceeded from Gods love for their great benefit and profit. And <hi>the feeble
knees</hi>] He draws a compariſon from a man wearied with running or
labouring, when the ſtrength of the ſinewes is ſo looſened, that the
hands hang and the knees totter, and all the members ſeeme as it were out of
joynt. The ſtrength of theſe parts both of hands and knees they muſt
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and proceed afreſh in the courſe of Chriſtianity till they
have finiſhed the race of it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And make ſtreight paths for your feet</hi>] By
paths he underſtands our accuſtomed actions, which are frequently uſed of
us, as paths uſe to be. And our paths are then ſtreight, when they anſwer
the rule of Chriſtian precepts and are agreeable unto it. The Author in
theſe words ſeemes particularly to admoniſh the Hebrewes, that they
ſhould deale candidly and openly in the profeſſion of Chriſtian verity,
and not ſeeke any by-wayes of hypocriſie and diſſimulation: For they
are ſaid to walke ſtreight, who deale candidly and openly, which Paul
reproving Peter, calls <hi>walking uprightly,</hi> Gal. 2.14. Contrarily, they
who deale not candidly, ſeeme to walke in by-paths and by turnings and
windings. <hi>Leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way</hi>] Hee
halteth or goeth lame, that in profeſſing of the truth, or in his life and
manners dealeth not ſo, as becommeth him. The Author intimates, that among
them to whom he wrote, there were ſome who halted in the waye of Chriſtian
verity and piety; and did incline ſometime one way, ſometime another; who

which may bee taken in two ſenſes; either for the luxation or ſprayning
of ſome member or joynt neceſſary for walking, which being diſlocated
will not ſuffer us to walke at all, but wholly takes away all uſe of
walking; or elſe for ſtraying from the way, which to moſt Interpreters
ſeemes moſt probable. The former of theſe agrees beſt with the Metaphor
of halting and <pb n="301" facs="tcp:61860:156"/>healing, which the Authour mentions
preſently after: but the latter ſutes beſt with the preceding words,
wherein wee are commanded to make ſtraight pathes for our feet; and that to
the end, that he who halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the path of Chriſtianitie might not be
turned out of the way, ſo that, to make ſtraight paths, and be turned out
of the way are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner oppoſed. For if he, who in the right way maketh
ſtraight pathes, or goeth ſtraight on, doth not erre from the right way;
then certainely he that erreth or turneth out of the way, maketh not ſtraight
pathes, But it eaſily fals out, that he who halteth in the path, doth at
laſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake it, and turnes aſide to the by-wayes of vices. But
it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the <hi>healing</hi> which hee mentions in the
words immediatly following, ſhould be properly and directly oppoſed to
<hi>turning out of the way,</hi> but onely that <hi>not turning out of the
way,</hi> ſhould bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſe then <hi>healing.</hi> For it is
cleare, that the Authour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares things unequall betweene themſelves, as
appeares by the particle <hi>rather;</hi> when hee ſaith; <hi>But let it
rather be healed.</hi>] This <hi>healing</hi> here is oppoſed to the
<hi>halting</hi> before, thus. Let him that halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or goeth <hi>lame,</hi>
not turne out of the way of pietie; or if he have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our of it, let him
returne into it againe, and leave his lameneſſe or halting therein, which
is to be healed of it: that being healed, he may walke on uprightly and
ſtrongly, lifting up the knees that were feeble, and fill his mind with
alacrity in the ſervice of God and Chriſt; for for want of this alacrity,
the ſpirituall lamenes or halting comes upon him.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>Follow peace with all men</hi>] Having finiſhed
his former exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to conſtancy in the faith, he now adds ſome
precepts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pietie; whereof the firſt is, to follow peace with
all men. Which precept is eſpecially moſt neceſſary to be obſerved of
Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons expoſed to all mens hatred, not onely for the
attaining of ſalvation, but alſo for the avoiding of divers calamities; as
Peter teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us. 1. Pet. 3.13. <hi>And holineſſe</hi>] Som thinke that
the word holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this place, ſignifies onely chaſtitie, as we
ſee Paul underſtands it. 1. Theſſ. 4.3. and 1. Tim. 2.15. But there is
no juſt reaſon, why we ſhould reſtraine a ſentence which may have
moſt conveniently a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe, and ſtreighten it to deſigne
onely chaſtitie; ſeeing other Chriſtian vertues pertain no leſſe then
it to Chriſtian ſanctification, and ſeperation from the profane multitude
of the world. See Epheſ. 5.26. where the word ſanctifying or hallowing is
extended to ſignifie the way of all pietie. <hi>Without which no man ſhall
ſee the Lord.</hi>] Becauſe in the Greek the article <hi>the</hi> is
prefixed before the Lord, therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common language of the
new Covenant, wee muſt here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom hee
that ſhall ſee, ſhall alſo ſee God himſelfe. And to ſee the Lord,
and by him to ſee God, containes all our future happines of immortalitie;
ſeeing, ſee him wee cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are made like him in nature, by being
made immortal. For this <pb n="302" facs="tcp:61860:157"/>ſight of God muſt be
underſtood of a cleare ſight, and ſuch an one, whereby, as John ſpeaks,
1. Epiſt. 3.2. Wee ſhall ſee God and Chriſt as they are; and of a
continuall ſight that ſhall laſt for ever; and a ſight that ſhall
flow from our converſation and company with the Lord. Wherefore he that
deſires the everlaſting ſight of God and Chriſt, let him ſeriouſly
endeavour to be holy, that is, to ſequeſter and ſeperate himſelfe from
the profane multitude of the world, not onely in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in life
and manners. For he to whom this holines is wanting, doth in vaine, poor
wretch, flatter himſelfe with the hope of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Looking ailigently</hi>] Another part of our
dutie is here declared; Namely, that wee ſhould not onely have a diligent
care of our owne lives, but we ſhould alſo be as it were viſitors and
overſeers one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that carrying a mutuall and common care for our
common ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we might ſo much the more eaſily and certainly attain
it. <hi>Left any man fall of the grace of God,</hi>] This is the thing
againſt which we muſt provide and looke diligently that it happen not
amongſt us. By this grace is underſtood the grace of the Goſpel, which is
conveyed unto men, by Chriſt, then which no greater grace could poſſibly
be done to mortall men. That man is ſaid to faile, who either ſtands
ſtill under this grace, or drawes backe from it; as we ſaw before, chap.
4.1. Such are all they who forſake the moſt ſacred Religion of Chriſt,
and will follow his Standerd no longer. <hi>Leſt any root of bitterneſſe
ſpringing up, trouble you.</hi>] The Authour here alludes to the words of
Moſes, Deut. 29.18. Wherein he likewiſe ſpeaketh of Apoſtats. By root
of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (which is an Hebraiſme for a bitter root) he
underſtands Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats; who are called bitter, becauſe both they
themſelves are bitter and unſavoury to God, and to the godly, and alſo
becauſe they bring forth fruit like themſelves, that is, very bitter and
ſowre. This root ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, or groweth, when a man dares utter unto
others that Apoſtacie which he had before, but conceived in his mind, and
onely cheriſhed in his owne boſome: or when it ſo increaſeth and
gathereth ſtrength in one perſon, that at laſt it ſpreads the infection
of it upon others. For the manner of it is for the moſt part to grow up and
get ſtrength by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; as faith doth, which is contrary to it; for that
which at the firſt is but ſmall and weake, doth afterward increaſe and
ſtrengthen. And Apoſtacy doth breed <hi>trouble,</hi> when it oppoſeth
the growth of faith and a good life in others; as plants and trees ſet too
neere, hinder one anothers growth, or as weeds hinder the growth of corne.
Although the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth
properly ſignifie to trouble and hinder a mans reſt; which Apoſtats
alſo commit, for they trouble the quiet and peace of the Church. <hi>And
thereby many be defiled</hi>] Pollution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing in this place, ſeems to
be put for infection; for many times by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing, a thing is infected. So a
garment defiled by the fleſh, is ſaid to <pb n="289" facs="tcp:61860:157"/>be infected
or ſpotted. Jude 23. by a Metaphor taken from the body, and a garment thereby
infected with the plague. And hither wee may referre that which is ſaid of
the tongue,) that it defiles the whole body. Jam. 3.6. where defiling, ſeemes
to be put for infecting; for in this ſenſe the Metaphor is the more
elegant; whereupon it is ſaid a little after at the 8. verſe, that the
tongue is full of deadly poiſon. The ſame therefore might bee intended in
this place, if wee reſpect the ſenſe of it. For things properly are not
defiled by rootes, but infected; for plants ſometime doe infect plants by
their mutuall contagion or touch of one another, yea by their very ſhadow
which they caſt upon other plants. But it may be the Authour receding from
the Metaphor of roots doth relate unto the perſons of whom he ſpake, who by
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metaphor are ſaid to be defiled, as often as they are infected with
errour or ſinne.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Leſt there be any fornicator or profane
perſon as Eſau.</hi>] It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether both theſe, the fornicator
and profane perſon be to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Eſau. Of Eſaus fornication wee
read nothing in the holy Scriptures, unleſſe wee referre hither his mariage
with the women of Canaan, againſt the manner and cuſtome of thoſe holy
men, who would not mingle their ſons ſeaſoned with the true worſhip of
God, with their daughters, who were deſtitute of the knowledge of God.
Therefore they might account ſuch mariage uncleane and inceſtuous. And
certainely we ſee God was provoked in this caſe, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to
bring the flood upon the whole world. Gen. 6.2. &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we read in
particular of the wives of Eſau, that they offended the minde of Iſaac and
Rebecca, in ſo much that Rebecca ſaid to Iſaac, I am weary of my life,
becauſe of the daughters of Heth. <hi>i.</hi> (The wives of Eſau) if Jacob
take a wife of the daughters of Heth, ſuch as theſe which are of the
daughters of the land, what good ſhall my life doe me? Gen. 27.46. And
Iſaac calling Jacob to him, charged him, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not take a
wife of the daughters of Canaan; Ariſe, goe to Padan aram to the houſe of
Bethuel thy mothers father, and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters
of Laban thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brother, Gen. 28.1.2. See alſo in the ſame Chap. ver.
6 7.8. For although Eſaus wives might bee unpleaſing and diſtaſtefull
to Iſaac and Rebecca by reaſon of their rudeneſſe, inſolencies, and
other vices, yet it is more likely, it was becauſe they ſprang from wicked
parents and came from a prophane ſtocke, wholly allien from the Religion and
worſhip of the true God, and were ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions falſe and impious. It appears alſo indeed that the family of
Bethuel and Laban himſelfe, whoſe daughters Jacob afterward mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, was
with all his houſhold given to Idolatry and the worſhip of falſe gods,
and was ſo bred from his very anceſtors; as appears, Gen. 31.19,30,32. and
Joſhua 24.2. yet it ſufficiently appears alſo, that in 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61860:158"/>that family the knowledge and worſhip of the true God
alſo was not wholly extinct, as in the time of Ahab it was not wholly extinct
in the Kingdome of Iſrael, ſee Gen. 24.50,51. and Gen. 29.32,33. and Gen.
30.6,27. and Gen. 31.16,24,49,50. But the Canaanites where wholly ignorant and
void of the true God. And what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe, who wholly
renouncing the worſhip of the true God, ſerve only falſe gods and idols,
and thoſe who joyne the worſhip of the true God, with idolatry and the
worſhip of falſe gods, doth eaſily appeare from 2 King. 17.24. and ſo
on to the end. Wherefore although Labans daughters were not free from the
worſhip of falſe gods, as appears from the paſſage formerly cited, Gen.
31.19,32. and Gen. 35.2. yet ſeeing they were alſo ſeaſoned with the
knowledge of the true God, they were therefore the leſſe prophane, and came
from a ſtocke the leſſe wicked, and ſeeing there could bee found no
women better, who were addicted only to the true Religion, it was therefore
moſt fit as the caſe ſtood, that the ſons of holy men ſhould take
their wives from theſe, and wave the women of Canaan, who were wholly
prophane and wicked. The Author therefore might taxe theſe marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in
Eſau as prophane, uncleane and inceſtuous: which alſo are moſt
carefully to be avoided of all Chriſtians; and ſo much the more, as they
are more holy then the ſonnes of the Patriarchs. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the
Author ſeems properly to brand that fornication, which was ſo growne into
cuſtome among the Gentiles, that it was ſcarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any vice or
diſhoneſty, as it plainly appears by the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſee Acts
15.20,29. Rom. 1.29. 1 Corinth. 6.13. And this ſin he would have to be far
from Chriſtians. And in the prohibition of fornication is included alſo the
prohibition of adultery, and of all kind of unclean pleaſures, becauſe they
are greater ſins. <hi>Or prophane perſon</hi>] That perſon properly is
prophane, who eſteems nothing holy, who either deſpiſeth things holy, or
diſcernes them not from things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. How this ſhould properly agree to
Eſau, it doth not equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. For the birth-right which he deſpiſed
and ſold for ſo baſe a price, was not a thing properly holy, though it
were a ſingular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and not to be deſpiſed: either therefore it
is not Eſau who is called prophane, but only he is propoſed for an example
of a prophane perſon, in regard he did an act reſembling prophaneneſſe.
Or if hee himſelfe be called a prophane perſon, he deſerved that
appellation by his likeneſſe to a prophane perſon, eſpecially ſeeing
his fact ſeems to be a ſigne of a prophane perſon. <hi>Who for one
morſell of meat ſold his birth-right.</hi>] The firſt borne both ſeemed
in a manner peculiarly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred unto God, and were the firſt and chiefe
heires of then parents, and by a naturall right had a prerogative and
preeminence above their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Whence under the Law the firſt borne was
to have a double portion out of his fathers inheritance, which came to as much
as any <pb n="305" facs="tcp:61860:158"/>two of his brethren, Deut. 21.17. Hence we read
that the dignity roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all was devolved from Reuben the firſt-borne of Jacob
unto Judah, paſſing by alſo Simeon and Levi who were elder then Judah;
becauſe all theſe had defiled themſelves with wickedneſſe. Reuben
becauſe he had gone up to his fathers bed; and the reſt becauſe they had
ſtained their hands with the murther of the Sichemites, and had made
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves incapable of that dignity. If therefore Eſau were filthy and
prophane, becauſe he ſold his birth-right for a morſell of meat; how much
more are they filthy, prophane and wicked, who being choſen and adopted for
the Sonnes of God in Chriſt, doe eſteem ſo baſely of their rights to
heaven, which God through his infinit mercy hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them, that
they countervalue them with fornications, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonies, and other baſe
pleaſures and ſins?</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>For ye know that afterward when he would have
inherited the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he was rejected</hi>] That we might learne what
great calamity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to prophane perſons ſuch as Eſau was, and
conſequently how much it concerns us to ſhun prophaneneſſe; therefore
the Author here ſhews what great incommondity it brought unto Eſau, that
afterward when he would have inherited the bleſſing due by the right of
nature to the firſt-borne above others, and ſued to his father Iſaac for
it, hee was rejected, becauſe he had already ſold it unto Jacob, and Jacob
had already gotten that bleſſing, God ſo ordering the matter; the ſame
calamity therefore remaines to all thoſe, that by luſts and uncleane
pleaſures, and ſuch like ſinnes diſable themſelves from the right of
that eternall bleſſing, whereto God of his great mercy had admitted them by
adopting them for his ſons. <hi>For he had no place of repentance, though he
ſought it carefully with teares</hi>] The Author therefore addes this, leſt
any prophane perſon ſhould thinke, that he could move God afterward by his
tears and cryes, not to deprive him finally of that bleſſing which is
heavenly happineſſe. For the ſame condition will befall them that
happened unto Eſau, who found no place for repentance, though hee ſought it
earneſtly with tears and cryes as the Scriptures teſtifie. From this place
it clearly appears, that to enjoy the birth-right and the chiefe bleſſing
otherwiſe due of courſe to the firſt-borne were things diſtinct. And
Eſau though he had not ſold his birth-right, might notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, God
ſo willing and diſpoſing, have failed of the chiefe bleſſing,
becauſe it was already ſetled upon Jacob. For if Eſau having now
ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and loſt his birth-right,
would yet have gotten the chiefe bleſſing, and did ſue with prayers and
teares to his father for it; why might not Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob though he had not gotten the
birth-right, aſpire to the bleſſing? was it not free for God to beſtow
it rather upon Jacob then Eſau? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore without the rejection of
his birth-right, Eſau might not be preferred before Jacob for the
bleſſing, yet ſeeing he had for merly deſpiſed his birth-right, hee
was altogether worthy to loſe the <pb n="306" facs="tcp:61860:159"/>fruit of it alſo,
that ſo he might faile of the bleſſing not only by Gods decree and
pleaſure, but by his owne fault and demerit. The pronoune <hi>it</hi> though
it may be relative to the bleſſing, yet it rather ſeems refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to
repentance; and yet not to the repentance of Eſau, but of Iſaac: For Eſau
muſt be ſuppoſed to ſeek that which he found not; for the Author doth
manifeſtly oppoſe theſe two one to the other, but hee found not
repentance, and therefore he ſought repentance. For to find no place of
repentance is all one with not to finde repentance, that the forme of the
oppoſition may the better appeare; unleſſe we ſay that one thing was
ſought, and another was not found; for the thing whoſe place cannot be
found, that thing cannot be made exiſtent. But now ſeeing Eſau ſought
not his owne repentance, for he did repent of his fact, and teſtified his
ſorrow with tears and cryes, it remaines therefore that by that repentance
whoſe place could not be found, wee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the repentance of Iſaac;
whereto Eſau by his weeping and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints would move Iſaac, that he would
revoke the bleſſing given to Jacob, and tranſlate it upon himſelfe. But
he was therein diſappointed and fruſtrated; for his teares and cryes came
too late and did not help him. And this point the Author leaves to the
conſideration of all prophane perſons, that after they have rejected or
neglected their right to eternall ſalvation, their tears and cryes will
availe them nothing, if they come too late, as all thoſe doe, which only then
are powred forth, when the time is paſt for amendment of life, and the time
already come for judgement and puniſhment; or elſe their tears are not
ſerious enough, and effectuall to a new courſe of life, and to true
holineſſe for the recovery of that right which they had loſt. For the
Author had determined it before, that without holines no man ſhould ſee the
Lord, ver. 14. And therefore a matter of this conſequence muſt not thinke
to be gained only with cryes and tears; wherein prophane perſons can be as
abundant, and commonly are more fluent then the true Saints of God. Hence it is
manifeſt, what we are to thinke of that repentance and ſorrow of minde as
they call it, which appears in perſons dying; who while they lived and were
healthy, followed their ſinnes, or as the Author ſaid before, ſinned
willingly after they had received the knowledge of the truth. For upon their
death-bed, the time of a true fruitfull repentance is paſt, and they are
called as it were to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Gods judgement. For although it is
better even then, to ſue alſo for Gods mercy with tears and cryes, then by
caſting away of all hope, to doe nothing at all for the compaſſing of
mercy; yet by force of the new Covenant, it death follow, and no time granted
them for the putting off the old man with his workes, and putting on the new,
they cannot be ſaved. Therefore ſuch have need of ſome extraordinary
grace and favour from God, which we have reaſon to think befals but a few,
and to none of thoſe who lived prophanely as Eſau did.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:61860:159"/>18. <hi>For ye are not come</hi>]
Here begins another part of the Chapter, wherein the Author uſeth a new
argument to perſwade them, from falling from the Grace of God, and Religion
of Chriſt, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo prophane, as to be more indulgent to
fornications, uncleanneſſes and other ſinnes, then to enjoy that
happineſſe whereto they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a right by their faith in Chriſt.
For he ſhewes, of what great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they are made partakers, by
receiving the Religion of Chriſt; and this he doth by framing of a
compariſon of them with thoſe things which long ſince befell to their
anceſtours in the publiſhing of the Law at Mount Sinai. And withall he doth
tacitly diſparage that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and terrible manner wherein the Law was
proclaimed, which happily was no ſmall motive to the Hebrewes, to think that
they were not to forſake the Law; whoſe proclamation was performed with
ſuch Majeſty. Having ſhewed the great benefits accruing by the Goſpell,
he thence infers, that they ought with all their endeavour to obey the voice of
the Goſpell; otherwiſe they ſhall fall upon terrible and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
judgements, not amoveable by any tears and cryes. Firſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he
mentions the things that of old happened to the Iſraelites at the publication
of the Law; and afterward to them he oppoſeth the things happening to
Chriſtians at the publication of the Goſpell. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>ye are not come to the Mount that might be touched</hi>] Ye came not,
namely, then when ye were initiated unto Chriſt, and were made members or
ſubjects unto him, as our anceſtors came long ſince, when they became
bound to the rules of the Law. And the things whereto the Iſraelites then
came, he ſhews to be partly contemptible, partly terrible. Mount Sinai was a
thing contemptible, which hee therefore termes the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable Mount, or the
Mount that might be touched; not only becauſe it might be ſo, but becauſe
it often had been ſo; for many times it had been both touched and trampled on
both by men and beaſts, whereto it was no leſſe expoſed then any other
Mountaine. The Iſraelites came to this Mount becauſe by Gods command they
were aſſembled at the foot of it, that there they might hear God delivering
the Law from the Mount. <hi>And that burned with fire</hi>] But the reſt of
the things that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he mentions are very terrible; for the Mount burned
with fire, which was ſo great and ſo high, that it burned up unto heaven,
as the ſacred Hiſtory relates it. <hi>Nor unto blackneſſe, and
darkneſſe, and tempeſt.</hi>] By blackneſſe we may underſtand that
thicke cloud, wherein God is ſaid to have deſcended; and the darkneſſe
was the great ſhadow which was cauſed by the overſpreading of that cloud,
which being extremely thick muſt needs induce an extraordinary darkneſſe.
And the Tempeſt was not by any violence of windes and raine, as by lightnings
and thunders, which ruſh with as much violence as windes in a tempeſt, and
many times are accompained with a tempeſt. All things were compoſed and
ſuted to inject feare and terror; for from the thicke <pb n="308" facs="tcp:61860:160"/>cloud and the darkeneſſe that it cauſed, there iſſued forth
a horrible burning of fire, the lightnings ſhined out, and the thunders
clapped; and beſides the thunders was a noiſe more fearefull; for the
noiſe of a trumpet that ſounded long and loud, and by degrees roſe lowder
and lowder filled the whole ayre; and that nothing might want for rerrour, the
whole Mount from the top to the bottome trembled and quaked, to the extreme
amazement of the people.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>And the ſound of a trumpet, and the voice of
words</hi>] The words were the commandements of the Law, and the voice was the
voice of God, wherewith the words of the Law were uttered from the top of the
Mount out of the midſt of the fire. For after that the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
ſummoned by the ſound of the trumpet ſtood at the foote of the Mount
ready to heare the Law, then God with a voice undoubtedly no leſſe terrible
then the ſound of the trumpet, publiſhed his will in the Law. For how
terrible Gods voice was, hereby it appeares, in that the Iſraclites
ſupplicated that God would ſpeake no more unto them. For ſo it followeth
in the reſt of the verſe. <hi>Which voice they that heard, entreated that
the word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more</hi>] The voice of God was
ſo terrible to the people, that thereby they were afraid of their lives; and
therefore entreated Moſes, that if there were any more to be ſpoken, he
would ſpeake it, and not God, leſt (ſay they) we dye. See Exod. 20.18,19.
and Deut. 5.25,26.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>For they could not endure that which was
commanded</hi>] If theſe words cohere with the words immediately following in
the verſe, <hi>and if ſo much as a beaſt touch the Mountaine it ſhall
be ſtoned, &amp;c.</hi> So that theſe words be taken for that which was
commanded, and which the people could not endure; wee may well doubt, how this
agrees with the Sacred hiſtory, from whence no ſuch things ſeemes to
appeare, that the people therefore deprecated Gods further ſpeech unto them,
becauſe they feared that command of not touching the Mount, and could not
endure it as a thing too grievous and dangerous to them: but rather therefore,
becauſe they were terribly afraid of that fire, out of which God ſpake; and
becauſe they imagined that God could not long ſpeake with man, but that
man, unable to beare the voice and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, muſt needs dye; as
appeares by their words to Moſes, See Deut. 5.24,25,26. Yet becauſe by
their words there it is manifeſt, that they feared to be conſumed by the
fire out of which God ſpake; it ſeemes that it could proceed from no other
reaſon, but becauſe they were afraid they might eaſily offend God and
provoke him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that fire would take hold of them. For why otherwiſe
ſhould they be ſo afraid of that fearefull but harmeleſſe fire, which
hurt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes nothing at all? And wherein could they ſooner and more eaſily
offend God, then if any of them ſhould paſſe the bounds ſet them by God
and touch the Mount? eſpecially when it was alſo to be feared, 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61860:160"/>that for the ſinne and raſhneſſe of ſome one or
a few, many might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that might ſeeme in ſome manner involved. For
the like had elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where fallen out in ſuch offences committed againſt the
Majeſty of God; eſpecially if the command were laid upon all, that no one
might dare to attempt, as here it was. Therefore it is credible, that the
Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites greatly in feare of this command, of not touching the Mount, nor
paſſing their bounds; and of not touching them that did tranſgreſſe
herein, but killing them afarre off with ſtones or darts, did entreate that
they might not be drawne out of their tents to heare the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and
thereby put in danger of tranſgreſſing that command and offending God;
for while they kept within their campe, they were ſafer from ſinning; and
if any raſh perſon ſhould go forth, and dare to paſſe the bounds that
God had ſet, he ſhould do it at his owne perill onely, and not endanger the
people by it, who were innocent of it. But being out of their campe, and drawne
ſo neere the Mount, it might eaſily fall out that ſome beaſt or man,
either preſſed forward by the multitude, as it often happens, or carried on
with his owne raſh and curious deſire to ſee God, would hardly containe
himſelfe within the bounds limited; and having once paſſed them, no man
might follow him to draw him back, but they muſt kill him afarre off with
ſtones and darts. And commonly in other mens dangers, eſpecially theirs who
ſtand allyed unto us, we forget our owne; and therefore it might eaſily
fall out, that the father willing to ſave his ſon, and the ſon his
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one friend another, and one neighbour another, many might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
themſelves in the common danger. What marvaile therefore is it, if the
Iſraelites could not endure that which was commanded, for not touching the
Mount, nor paſſing their bounds, and therefore entreated that God would
ſpeake to them no more, in regard of the great danger wherein they ſtood to
heare him? To him whom this way ſatisfies not, we may ſay, that the words
<hi>they could not endure that which was commanded,</hi> need not be referred
to the words following, but may be read in a parentheſis, to declare what was
ſpoken next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But the following words, <hi>and if ſo much as a
beaſt touch &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put by themſelves ſerve to amplifie the
great terrour of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle; as alſo doth the whole verſe following.
If we follow this way, then the Author ſeemes to have uttered theſe words
in a double ſence. One is hiſtoricall according to the ordinary
conſtruction of the words themſelves: the other is typicall, which is as it
were a figure or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the things hiſtoried. The hiſtoricall ſence
is, that the Iſraelites could not endure that voice of God, whereby hee gave
his Laws and commands. But this ſence though it agree with the hiſtory, yet
it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complies with the words. The other ſence ſhews not what was
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done of the Iſraelites, but what was repreſented or ſhadowed out
by what was done. The people entreated, that the word might be 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61860:161"/>ſpoken to them no more. Why ſo? Becauſe (ſaith
the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) they could not endure that which was commaunded; for the burden of
the Commandments was too heavie for their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They doe not indeed
ſay this, neither do they feele it, but by their fact and refuſall they
intimate and ſhadow it. For as that voyce wherewith the commandments were
publiſhed, being grievous and terrible, was a ſigne of the gravitie and
weightineſſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Law: ſo the peoples not
enduring that God ſhould ſpeake to them and command them, was a ſecret
token that the people could not beare the burden of the commands of the Law.
For the ſacred Scriptures of the new Teſtament, when they ſpeake of a
thing which hapned under the Law, doe commonly ſo ſpeake of it, as if the
thing were then done, which then was onely typically ſignified. Whereof we
have an evident example in Paul, when hee ſaith, that Moſes put a vaile
over his face, that the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly looke to
the end of that which is aboliſhed. 2. Cor. 3.13. when yet, if we look into
the Hiſtory, that was done for another cauſe, namely, becauſe the
Iſraelites could not endure the luſtre of Moſes his face for the
brightnes of it: But becauſe that vailing of Moſes his face, was a type and
ſhadow of the thing which Paul mentions, therefore the thing it ſelfe is
ſaid to be done. In a like manner of ſpeech, the names of the antitypes are
ſometime attributed to the types. So before chap. 11. ver. 26. wee ſee that
the reproach of the Iſraelites in Egypt, was called the reproach of Chriſt.
And that wee may goe no farther, even in this chapter a little after, at the
25. verſe, this very refuſall of the people, wherein they entreated, that
God would ſpeake no more unto them, is taken for that, which in like manner
was ſignified by another type, namely for contumacy and diſobedience
againſt God. For when the Authour at the ſaid 25. verſe ſaith, that
they eſcaped not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who refuſed him that ſpake on earth; it
is manifeſt that hee hath relation to that refuſall, which he mentioneth in
this place. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall, which cauſed the Iſraelites to incurre
Gods diſpleaſure and bee puniſhed, and which we alſo muſt by all
meanes avoide, as by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor we are admoniſhed at the 25. verſe, was
not their refuſall to heare God ſpeak unto them without an interpreter (for
that was wholly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God, as we read, Deut. 5.28,29,30.) but the
thing that under that refuſall was covertly ſhadowed, and tacitely
preſaged, namely, that in future time it would come to paſſe, that they
would indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to heare, that is, to obey the voyce of God. In like
manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place the Iſraelites are ſaid to refuſe, that
God ſhould give them more precepts, or ſpeake further unto them, becauſe
they could not endure more, yea, not them which they had heard already; not
that this was their mind and ſenſe, but that this was the ſenſe of
their fact, as afterward the event ſhewed. <hi>Shall be ſtoned or thruſt
thorow with a dart.</hi>] <pb n="311" facs="tcp:61860:161"/>This latter clauſe is not
extant either in the old Latine tranſlation, nor in the Syriak: yet it
manifeſtly agrees with the Hiſtory. Exod. 19.13. This was therefore
commanded, becauſe (as we ſaid) it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to recall or reduce
either man or beaſt, that had tranſgreſſed the bounds ſet, but it
muſt be diſpatched or ſlain a farre off with ſtones or darts. <hi>If
ſo much as a beaſt</hi>] As if he had ſaid, much leſſe might any man
touch the Mount, who is the proper ſubject of ſinne and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>And ſo terrible was the ſight, that Moſes
ſaid, I exceedingly feare and quake.</hi> The Author amplifies the terrours
of that ſight; as if hee had ſaid; the ſpectacle or ſight that
appeared, was ſo terrible and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that not onely the promiſcuous
multitude ſtroke with extreame terrour, entreated they might not be
conſtrained to ſtand and hear any more: but even Moſes alſo who was the
Mediator and Meſſenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the people, ſaid, <hi>I
exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> That ever Moſes ſaid this, wee no where
read in the ſacred Hiſtory: but without doubt the Author affirmed it, as
knowne to him by ſome other meanes. See chap. 9.19.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>But yee are come</hi>] Here follows the other
part of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon which the Author had framed; wherein hee ſhewes,
how far the things, whereof we are made partakers by meanes of the Goſpel,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe, which of old befell the Iſraelites at the promulgation of
the Law. This acceſſe or comming muſt be underſtood of a ſpirituall
acceſſe or approach, as unto things and perſons ſpirituall; for it is
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to that carnall acceſſe or comming of the Iſraelites to the
earthly Mount. Yet this acceſſe muſt further be underſtood diverſly,
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divers things and perſons, which are here mentioned. In
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, it conſiſteth in a kinde of conjunction, which wee have with
thoſe things and perſons, as in ſome meaſure thence forward pertaining
to us: although alſo this conjunction be divers according to the
diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe things and perſons. <hi>Vnto Mount Sion.</hi>] Hee
oppoſeth Mount Sion unto Mount Sinai, whereto the Iſraelites came when the
Law was publiſhed. But Mount Sion even taken properly, was farre more
beautifull and comely then Mount Sinai, neither was it ſeated in the
wildernes, but in the land of Promiſe. And there can be no doubt, but by
Mount Sion in this place, that muſt be underſtood, whereto the Mount was
but a figure and a ſhadow. For as the thing figured is ſometime uſed for
the figure, as was ſhewed a little before: ſo much more often is the figure
taken for the thing figured. And although ſometime by Sion and the holy Mount
the Church it ſelf be ſhadowed; yet becauſe Jeruſalem the Citie of the
living God, which the Author mentions in the ſecond place, may more fitly be
referred to ſignifie the Church, therefore by Mount Sion, wee may better
underſtand heaven it ſelfe, or ſome ſpirituall Mount, whoſe top is
heaven the dwelling of <pb n="312" facs="tcp:61860:162"/>everlaſting
bleſſedneſſe. For we read more frequently, that heaven is ſignified
by mount Sion then the Church. For as in one head of mount Sion, which was
called Morea, the temple of God was built, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God was ſaid to dwell:
there was alſo in another head of it, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of David, who was a type or
ſhadow of Chriſt the king of Gods people: ſo in heaven truely is, the
temple of the moſt high God, and there is alſo the palace of Chriſt our
heavenly king. Therefore we ſay that in this place may be ſignified ſome
ſpirituall mount, whoſe top is heaven; becauſe by the heavenly
Jeruſalem (as wee ſhall ſhew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) the Church may ſeeme to be
underſtood, as it is now exiſtent upon earth. But the allegory will be more
full, if by Mount Sion wee underſtand, not onely heaven it ſelfe; but
conceive in our minde ſome ſpirituall mount, whoſe top is in heaven, and
his foot reacheth unto earth, that as of old Jeruſalem was ſeated at the
foot and forward upon the ſide of Mount Sion: ſo alſo the Church as it is
now on earth, may be ſaid to be built and ſo forward on the ſide of a
Mount which hath his top in Heaven; that is, hath a great vicinity and
contiguity with Heaven, and is already in ſome degree raiſed up into
Heaven; as they who dwell at the foot and ſide of ſome Mountaine, are
neareſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours and borderers to that Mountaine, and have not only
liberty to aſcend it, but in regard they already poſſeſſe the ſides
of it are in ſome degree promoted toward the top. We therefore are come to
heaven it ſelfe, or to that ſpirituall mount or ſtate, whoſe top is
heave; as we are made neighbours unto heaven, and have a right and liberty to
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend it, yea in ſome ſenſe we may well be ſaid inhabitants of it;
for from the Church there is a neare and open paſſage even to the top of
heaven. Hence it appears, that not only this Mount whereto we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are
come by the preaching of the Goſpel and by our faith given unto it, is by
infinite degrees, and without all compariſon far ſurpaſſing Mount
Sinai: but that our acceſſe alſo or comming to it, doth farre
ſurpaſſe the acceſſe or comming of the Iſraelites, who ſtood near
that Mount, but had no right to aſcend it, nor liberty to touch it,
unleſſe they would preſently be overwhelmed with ſtones, or ſtruck
through with darts. <hi>And unto the city of the living God</hi>] What City
this is, he preſently declares by ſaying, <hi>the heavenly
Ieruſalem</hi>] The attribute <hi>heavenly</hi> doth manifeſtly ſhew that
here he treats of that Jeruſalem, whereof that earthly City, the head of the
Kingdome of Iſrael, was but a type and a ſhadow. Hence alſo it appears,
that this City whereof the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor treats, is by far greater reaſon called
both the City of God, and Jeruſalem; that is, the ſight of peace (by which
word the Hebrewes uſe to underſtand happineſſe.) But this heavenly
Jeruſalem may bee underſtood to be the City of the living God in a double
ſenſe. Firſt ſo, as it ſignifies ſome ſtately place, deſtined
for the dwelling of the godly; and ſo wholly different from the Church, that
is the City ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb n="313" facs="tcp:61860:162"/>foundations whoſe builder is God,
and which God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and for their
ſpirituall poſterity, whereof we ſpake in the former Chapter. And theſe
buildings and palaces ordained for the habitation of the godly, are ſituated
(as I may ſay) in Heaven, as the City Jeruſalem poſſeſſed the
ſpaces of Mount Sion. This City he underſtands in the Chapter following,
ver. 14. when he ſaith, <hi>Here we have no continuing City, but we ſeek
one to come</hi>] And this ſenſe ſeems moſt proper to this place. But
ſecondly, this City of the heavenly Jeruſalem may be taken for the
ſtructure of the Church it ſelfe, which conſiſeth not of any houſes,
but of ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons joynted and compoſed one with another in a
peculiar order and frame. And that is in a manner twofold. For one ſtructure
of the Church is upon earth, though that Church be heavenly alſo: the other
ſhall be hereafter in heaven; both of theſe are underſtood by the
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem in the Revelation of St. John, chap. 21.2. &amp;c. and
ver. 9.10. For that the Church or her ſtructure is there meant, it appeares
by this, in that ſhe is called the Bride of the Lambe, and the twelve
foundations of her wall are ſaid to be ſigned with the names of the twelve
Apoſtles of the Lambe, and many things there read of her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that ſhe
is there conſidered, both as ſhe is for the preſent on earth, and as
ſhe ſhall be for the time to come in heaven. For the preſent, in that
ſhe is ſaid to deſcend from heaven, and that Kings and Nations are ſaid
to bring their glory into her, and to walke in her light. For the future, in
that they only who overcome, and who are written in the Lambs booke of life,
have the promiſe of entrance into that City, and poſſeſſion there. So
that the great ſplendor and magnificence as it is there deſcribed, is much
more appliable to expreſſe the future ſtate and happines of the Church,
then the preſent. But yet notwithſtanding, that ſome men as inhabitants
are ſeperate from this ſtructure of the Church, (though the Church
conſiſt of men, ſeaſoned with certaine qualities and joyned one to
another in a due order) that is only in reſpect of ſingle perſons
conſidered apart by themſelves. So Paul ſaid that Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy was in the
houſe of God, which is the Church; and Peter when he had ſaid, that we
muſt be built into a ſpirituall houſe, he preſently adds, that we
muſt be a holy Prieſthood; that is, as it were a holy Colledge of
Prieſts: But Prieſts muſt remaine in the houſe of God, and intend the
ſervice of God, and ſo doe much differ from the houſe of God. But the
ſame perſons conſidered in a diverſe reſpect, are both the houſe
and the Prieſts, yea and in a manner the ſacrifices. How ever therefore
this Jeruſalem be taken, it is the City of the living God, and heavenly. This
is manifeſt of that heavenly City built by God himſelfe, wherein we ſhall
ſometime dwell, and of the Chuch as hereafter it ſhall bee in heaven; and
it is true of the Church as it now is on earth. For it is a City, becauſe it
is built or compoſed of ſingle perſons notably qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61860:163"/>and excellently ordered; and by this City may be alſo
underſtood the very ſociety of men. It is the City <hi>of the living
God</hi>] not only becauſe the living God hath thus built it; but alſo and
much rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God dwells in it in a far more peculiar, and more divine
manner, then ever formerly in the City of Jeruſalem. For God inhabits it not
only by his Angels, but by his holy Spirit, who is the maine bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God
and his Church. And alſo becauſe it is wholly proper and intirely
conſecrate unto God, and no perſon hath right to dwell in it, but ſuch as
belong to God, ſuch as feare and worſhip him. It is <hi>heavenly,</hi>
becauſe the Church hath her originall from heaven (whence in the Revelation
that new Jeruſalem is ſaid to deſcend from heaven) and the forme or
faſhion of her is heavenly, and not earthly. She hath her originall from
heaven, becauſe whatſoever is requiſite for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of her,
proceeds not from elſewhere, but only from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of heaven; her
forme is heavenly, becauſe her doctrine is heavenly, her holineſſe of
life is heavenly, and that charity whereby her frame is chiefly compacted, is
heavenly. Laſtly, the order and ranke of her members, whereby ſome ſtand
before or after others ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of Eccleſiaſticall offices, or
in reſpect of divine gifts, is heavenly, and not earthly. And God is called
the living God, as he is oppoſed both to falſe gods and to true gods: To
the falſe gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lives; whereas the falſe gods, ſaving what
mens opinion attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to them, are nothing but ſtatues of wood, ſtone or
metall, and ſo things wholly inanimate and void of life: and he is oppoſed
to the true gods, becauſe he hath life from himſelfe, and is the author of
life to all that live, ſo that he is eminently called the living God; as
hereof wee have ſpoken elſewhere. <hi>And to an innumerable company of
Angels</hi>] He alludes to that multitude of Angels, which in Mount Sinai were
aſſiſtent to that Angel, who ſuſtained the name and perſon of God;
as it appeares Pſal. 6.68.17. where twenty thouſand ſignifies a plurality
of myriads, for every ten thouſand makes a myriade; and thouſands in the
plurall number uttered indefinitly may ſignifie that innumerable company, or
the univerſall and infinite army of Gods Angels. To the company of theſe,
Chriſtians come, as they are incorporated into one family and fellowſhip
with them, as the Angels become fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants with them, to worſhip and
ſerve one common God and Lord with them. So that the Angels carry
themſelves no longer as ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours unto men, eſpecially unto
Chriſtians; neither when they are ſeen of men, much leſſe unſeen, doe
they ſuffer any worſhip or divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to bee done unto them. Alſo as
the Angels are alwayes preſent with men, as ſent to miniſter for their
ſakes: and laſtly, as men have a right to the ſame immortality, which the
Angels enjoy, and ſhall in time ſo certainly attaine it, that they ſhall
become like unto the Angels.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:61860:163"/>23. <hi>To the generall
aſſembly, and Church of the firſt borne</hi>] So all the Greeke copies
have it; though the vulgar Latine, Eraſmus and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, place the word
<hi>aſſembly</hi> in the former verſe, and refer it to the innumerable
company of Angels: But whether this Aſſembly be taken relatively to the
angels, or collectively for that great corporation or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety compoſed of
Angels and Chriſtians, it comes all to one; becauſe theſe conjoyned make
up a generall or rather an univerſall aſſembly of all the worſhippers
and ſervitors of God. By the <hi>firſt borne</hi> we muſt underſtand
the firſt-borne of God, for of whom elſe ſhould they bee the
firſt-borne? and there is no doubt but theſe ſignifie Chriſtians, and
not thoſe who lived before Chriſt; for the men of thoſe times are not
wont to be called ſimply and abſolutely the Sonnes of God in the plurall
number, much leſſe the firſt-borne of God; unleſſe their rulers and
ſuch as have received ſome ſingular benefit of God, are ſometimes
called Gods and the Sonnes of God. But this appellation is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proper
to Chriſtians, who only are endued with that filiall ſpirit, wherein ſo
boldly and confidently they cry, Abba Father. Beſides (as afterward we
ſhall ſee) that company of the godly who lived before the times &amp; faith
of Chriſt, is ſignified by another name and called the <hi>juſt men made
perfect.</hi>] Now if the firſt-borne ſignifie Chriſtians, and yet cannot
ſignifie all them, as the word and diſtinction of firſt-borne between
them and thoſe that are come in unto them, declares; whom by this name
ſhall we better underſtand, then thoſe who firſt in every place
received the Chriſtan Religion, and went before thoſe that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
followed them? who alſo are ſometimes called the firſt-fruits of that
place wherein they lived; among whom the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the New
Teſtament lead the firſt file, being the firſt fruits of Judea it
ſelfe, and in a manner the firſt-borne of all the Sonnes of God or
faithfull in Chriſt, eſpecially the Apoſtles. But why we think that the
Author ſpake not of theſe only, we are perſwaded by the word generall
aſſembly (for hither we conceive it ſhould be referred, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the
common authority of the Greekes) which ſignifies an univerſall concourſe
or huge company of people met together, which could not be made up only of the
Apoſtles and Prophets of the New Teſtament: Wherefore this generall
aſſembly muſt be further exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; which if it be, then nothing is more
probable, but that by firſt-borne is underſtood in this place (as we have
ſaid) the firſt-fruits of the faithfull in every place. For they were
worthily of greateſt eſteem among the Chriſtians, they had the double
portions as it were of the Holy Ghoſt, or to ſpeake in the words of the
Apoſtle, they had the firſt fruits of the Spirit, and were endued with
divine gifts above other men. But ſome may demand, whether the Author alludes
in the word firſt-borne, if he allude at all, which if he doe, it ſeems it
is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt-borne under the Law, into whoſe place the Levites
were <pb n="316" facs="tcp:61860:164"/>choſen, to miniſter in the Sanctuary: or to the
univerſall aſſembly of the Iſraelites when they ſtood at the foote of
Mount Sinai to heare the Law. For the former opinion it makes, firſt from the
word firſt-borne; for firſt-borne are moſt fitly oppoſed to the
firſt-borne. Secondly, in that theſe Hebrews, to whom the Author writes,
being ſeaſoned by the Apoſtles with the doctrine of Chriſt, ſeeme
anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that firſt aſſembly of the Iſraelites at Mount Sinai
to heare the Law. Which if it be ſo, then the firſt borne can ſcarce
ſignifie the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall multitude of the firſt Chriſtians or the
firſt common Church: ſeeing there muſt be ſome who had acceſſe, and
other ſome to whom the acceſſe was had: unleſſe we ſay, that
theſe Hebrewes are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſome part of the primitive aſſembly
of Chriſtians, anſwering to that part of the Iſraelites aſſembly
which firſt received the Law deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from God himſelfe. For if by the
heavenly Jeruſalem the Church be ſignified, theſe Hebrewes can be ſaid
to come unto it, no otherwiſe then as the part to the whole. Thirdly,
becauſe by theſe firſt-borne ſome excellent and eminent men in the
Church ſeeme to be underſtood, as put in a meane betweene God and Angels;
for theſe very fitly anſwer the firſt-borne, and to the Levites and
Prieſts choſen into their roome; as are the Apoſtles, Prophets,
Evangeliſts and other excellent and eminent men, who went before all that
followed them not onely in time but in gifts. And it is probable that the
Author would make particular mention of them; and then, they were not
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in other words then theſe. The other opinion is favoured by
the word generall aſſembly, which ſignifies an univerſall meeting; and
likewiſe the word Church. For that generall aſſembly of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
who met at Mount Sinai to heare the Law, was called the Church, Acts 7.38.
Hence it appeares, of what great dignity they are, who have received the
Religion of Chriſt, becauſe they are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated as it were into one body
and into one Church with that Church of the firſt-borne; and who as S. Peter
ſaith, have obtained like precious faith with them, 2 Pet. 1.1. and enjoy the
ſame right with them of happineſſe and ſalvation. He calls them the
generall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and Church of the firſt-borne, becauſe though all
theſe firſt borne did never yet aſſemble in any one place upon earth,
for this ſhall be done hereafter onely in heaven, yet becauſe of the
ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and likeneſſe of dignity and condition that is
betweene them, they are conſidered as one aſſembly and in a manner as one
company. <hi>Which are written in heaven</hi>] He ſeemes to allude to the
number-rolle or liſt of the names of the firſt-borne, or of all the
Iſraelites; for God commanded Moſes to taken the number of both theſe:
but both theſe were written on earth: but the lift of Chriſtians is written
in heaven, and written by God. So that by theſe words their dignity and
happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is notified. But the Greek word is

common-wealth, that their God is alwayes mindfull of them, ſeeing he keeps
their names as it were written in a booke; and therefore it cannot be but in
due time he will put them in poſſeſſion of his heavenly kingdome.
Whence alſo they that come unto them, or are aggregated to their number, are
reckoned with them for citizens of heaven, and members of that heavenly
common-wealth. <hi>And to God the judge of all</hi>] But ſome may here ſay,
that the Iſraelites came long ſince unto God, and therefore here is nothing
ſaid, that concernes Chriſtians in particular. I anſwer. 1. That they
when they came to Mount Sinai, did not really and truly come to God himſelf,
but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to an angel who ſuſtained the perſon and Name of God. 2. That
they came not in that manner that Chriſtians doe unto God, who as S. John
ſaith, come into a communion and fellowſhip with God, 1 John 1.3. and into
ſuch a communion, that they are reckoned the ſons of God, and in time to
come ſhall be his heires; in witneſſe whereof they have received the
earneſt of his holy Spirit, Epheſ. 1.14. 3. The Iſraelites came not unto
God as unto him whom they knew to be the Judge of all; or rather who then
caried himſelfe as the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Judge of all men, of all countries and
nations both quick and dead. Now the name of Judge may be here taken either
largely for any Lord and governour: or ſtrictly for him, who according to
mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits decrees and payes rewards and puniſhments. Anciently God tooke
the peculiar charge and governement over the people of Iſrael onely: but now
he hath a fatherly care equally over all men of what Nation ſoever, ſo they
be Chriſtians, yea he provides that they become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Alſo he
ordaines rewards and puniſhments for all men not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life, but
alſo after it; which to thoſe firſt Iſraelites was not knowne,
eſpecially in regard of thoſe tranſcendent rewards to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated after
this life upon the godly, without any difference of Nation. <hi>And to the
ſpirits of juſt men made perfect</hi>] He ſeemes now to mention theſe
that he tacitly may ſhew; what a great happineſſe it is, to come to the
Judge of all men, both the living and the dead. By the <hi>Iuſt</hi> he
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands thoſe men deceaſed notable for their righteouſneſſe,
whereof he reckoned up no ſmall number in the former Chapter treating of
faith in God. And he ſaith that Chriſtians are come to the <hi>ſpirits of
the juſt</hi>] becauſe there is now nothing left of them but their
ſpirits, which God hath received into his faith and cuſtody, as the Judge
of all. And the juſt or righteous deceaſed, are ſaid to be made perfect,
not that they now enjoy finall happineſſe, and really poſſeſſe the
finall promiſe of God (for otherwiſe Chriſtians had not come to their
ſpirits onely but <pb n="318" facs="tcp:61860:165"/>rather to them themſelves; &amp; in
the former chapter he denied that they had already received the promiſe of
God, and were made perfect) but that their ſtate and condition is ſuch,
that perfection and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is now remaining to them in a way
immutable; ſo that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of attaining it is ſuch, as if they did
already really enjoy it. In this very ſenſe Saint Paul uſeth the ſame
word of himſelfe, when hee ſaith, <hi>Not as though I had already attained,
either were already perfect.</hi>] Phil. 3.12. that is, not that I am now in
that ſtate, as if I could no way faile of that bleſſed reſurrection
(for of this it was, that he ſpake in the former verſe;) for otherwiſe
that he had not yet really attained eternall life, no man could be ignorant,
and it were a fond thing to affirme it. The Author therefore ſhews that
thoſe juſt ones, though they had not attained eternall ſalvation in
perfection, in regard now nothing of them was extant but their ſpirits, yet
without all doubt ſhould certainely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, by the immutable decree of
God. Hence it appeares, what it is for God to be Judge of all, and what
happineſſe is therein contained, if a man come both to the Judge, and to
the ſpirits of the juſt, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their ſociety. For thereby
he is certain, though his life here-faile him, yet he ſhall not faile of the
reward of eternall life.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>And to Ieſus the Mediatour of the new
Teſtament.</hi>] The Iſraelites heretofore came to Moſes the Mediatour of
the old Teſtament: but Chriſtians come to Jeſus the Mediatour of the New.
But how much Jeſus is better then Moſes, and the new Covenant better then
the old, we have ſhewed before, chap. 3.8. and chap. 8.6. The word Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
is in a manner proper to the holy Scripture; and peradventure no where uſed
among profane Authors, as others have noted. Yet it is found out of the
Sciptures, in Philo, who being a Jew, uſed a forme of language that had
ſome affinity with the ſacred writers. And what this word ſignifies being
uſed of Chriſt, we are eaſily taught by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Moſes, to whom
that name was firſt attributed. For although of it owne nature, it may
ſignifie any one who intervenes as a meane betweene two parties: yet the
example of Moſes and the name of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant added, that thereby is ſignified
no other but an herald, or hee who intervenes as a mean between God and men to
make a Covenant, for the joyning of them in a mutuall and firme peace and
friendſhip. For the effecting whereof, it is not forthwith neceſſary to
appeaſe and mitigate the minde either of one or both parties; when it may be
either both parties, as it was in the making of the old Covenant, or one of
them as it was under the new, namely God, doth freely incline to peace and
friendſhip, yea doth alone, ſeeke, offer, and procure it. <hi>And to the
blood of ſprinkling</hi>] An Hebraiſme for the blood which is ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
or wherewith aſperſion is made. Hee alludes to that blood of the old
Covenant, wherewith Moſes, after hee had rehearſed all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the
Law, ſprinkled both the booke of the Law, and the whole <pb n="319" facs="tcp:61860:165"/>people; whereof he ſaid, This is the bloud of the Teſtament,
which God hath enjoyned unto you; as we had it before, chap. 9. verſ. 19, 20.
We Chriſtians are in like manner ſprinkled with bloud, and that with the
moſt precious blood of Chriſt himſelfe. And wee are ſprinkled with the
bloud of Chriſt, when in our hearts wee conceave and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the force of
that bloudy death which he ſuffered, to confirme the new Covenant; in ſuch
manner that thereby wee have an infallible aſſurance made us of the
promiſes comprehended in the Covenant, whence it comes to paſſe that wee
are made parties to the Covenant, and obtaine a right of attaining to all the
bleſſings promiſed therein. <hi>That ſpeaketh better things then that
of Abel.</hi>] He commends this bloud wherewith Chriſtians are ſprinkled,
by mentioning the force and effect of it; that they may joy the more for their
aſperſion with it, and may moreover more carefully endeavour, that they
waſh not the droppes of that bloud from their ſoules; that is, that they
never fall away from the new Covenant, nor ceaſe to feel the force of the
bloud of Chriſt, and ſo deprive themſelves of that great bleſſing,
which they gained by the ſhedding of it, namely, a right to eternall
happineſſe. To the blood of Chriſt hee aſcribes ſpeech (in a
figurative ſenſe) as likewiſe to the bloud of Abel. Both their blouds
ſpeake, or as the Scripture ſaith, of the bloud of Abel, both cry unto God:
but Abels bloud cryes for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon his fratricide: but Chriſts bloud
cryes for remiſſion and pardon even upon paricides; for they may juſtly
be called paricides, who murdered Chriſt. And unto theſe no leſſe then
unto all other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the bloud of Chriſt begs pardon from God of all
their ſinnes, if they will repent and be converted from them. And he begs it,
as hee engageth God to grant forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to all penitent
perſons, whatſoever their ſinnes have been. And he engageth God, as hee
was employed of God to confirme and eſtabliſh the new Covenant, which is
ſo remarkable for that promiſe.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>See that yee refuſe not him that
ſpeaketh.</hi>] To his former paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges hee now ſubjoynes an
Exhortation, and fortifies it with new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And herein he ſeemes to
allude to that fact of the Iſraelites whereof we ſpake before, when they
were ſtricken with ſuch terrour of Gods Majeſty, that they entreated,
that God would ſpeak no more unto them; which fact of theirs was a kinde of
preſage or token, that afterward they would not carry an ear and mind
obedient to the voice of God. He therefore admoniſheth Chriſtians, that
now, after they have given their ear and mind to the voyce of God in the
Goſpel, they would not againe turne their ear and mind from it; which is done
both by Apoſtacy and by diſobedience. See, <hi>i.</hi> take diligent heed;
for they who take diligent heed, caſt about their eyes every way, that they
may eſcape the danger imminent. <hi>For if they eſcaped not</hi>] By an
argument of compariſon, hee ſhewes that if they doe otherwiſe, they
ſhall not <pb n="320" facs="tcp:61860:166"/>eſcape a grievous puniſhment; for they
the Iſraelites <hi>eſcaped not,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the puniſhment and avenging
hand of God, whereof wee treated, chapters the 3. and 4. where wee ſaw that
the Iſraelites for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and diſobedience, were debarred from
entrance into that land of Promiſe, wherein they ſhould have reſted after
their grievous ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in Egypt, and periſhed in the wilderneſſe by
divers deſtructions. <hi>Who refuſed him that ſpake on earth; much more
ſhall not we eſcape, if we turne away from him that ſpeaketh from
heaven.</hi>] He oppoſeth him who ſpake on earth to him who ſpake from
heaven; Now there can be no doubt, but by him who ſpake from heaven, hee
underſtands God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for preſently after he addes verſe 26.
<hi>Whoſe voice then ſhooke the earth: but now hee hath promiſed,
ſaying, yet once more I ſhake not the earth onely but alſo heaven.</hi>
For here it is manifeſt that the whole verſe is meant of God. But who
ſhall wee ſay is underſtood by him, who ſpake on earth? By him may be
underſtood both God himſelfe, and that ſingle Angel who bare the name and
perſon of God in Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai. If by him wee underſtand God himſelfe,
then here will be no oppoſition betweene divers perſons, but onely betweene
divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from whence God delivered the Law, and from whence the
Goſpel; Namely, that the Law was publiſhed on earth from Mount Sinai, but
the Goſpel was publiſhed by God from heaven. You will ſay, that God then
no leſſe publiſhed the Law from heaven, then afterward he did the
Goſpell; ſeeing God himſelfe deſcends not from heaven, but as he ſent
Chriſt from heaven to preach the Goſpel; ſo he ſent an Angell from
heaven in his name to deliver the Law. To this I anſwer; There is a great
difference between the miſſion or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſt from God, and of
that Angel. For Chriſt being ſent from God carried himſelfe alwayes as a
perſon diverſe from God (which the thing it ſelfe declares, for he was
the ſonne of man) and called himſelf Gods meſſenger ſent from God,
did manifeſtly profeſſe and teſtifie that his doctrine was not his owne
but his who ſent him, that he ſpake nothing of himſelfe, but what he had
received and heard from the Father. But that Angell ſo deſcended from
heaven, that hee bare the perſon and name of God, and therefore he alwayes
ſpeaks as if he had been God himſelfe. And this was the cauſe why
Chriſt had not ſuch Majeſty and viſible glory about him, as had that
Angel. For Chriſt had but that Majeſty and glory, which became Gods legate
or meſſenger, and he a man, and a mortall man. But that Angell had that
Majeſty and glory, which was ſutable to God himſelfe, if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
had deſcended from Heaven. It may therefore be well ſaid, that God
himſelfe deſcended in that Angell, and muſt be conſidered as if he
himſelfe had ſpoken upon earth. Contrarily, becauſe God ſent Chriſt
to preach the Goſpell as his Apoſtle or meſſenger, and ſent him from
heaven as a perſon diſtinct from him; not as of old he ſent Moſes 
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61860:166"/>from the earth, that is, but from Mount Sinai; therefore
now with good reaſon he is ſaid to deliver his oracles, and to publiſh
his pleaſure to us from heaven. But it is a far greater matter to deliver
oracles from heaven it ſelfe then from earth, or from ſome earthly
mountaine, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heaven is far higher and worthier then any mountaine.
Therefore although the manner which God uſed in publiſhing and revealing
his Goſpel, was not, if we reſpect the outward ſhew and ſplendour of
it, ſo illuſtrious, as that wherewith he publiſhed the Law: yet indeed it
was far more divine and perfect, and in all reſpects moſt beſeeming the
perfect diſcipline of Evangelicall truth. For what elſe did it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that God deſcended on earth to publiſh the Law, but that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of
the Law were earthly and not heavenly. For they that ſpeake from a low place
ſeem to ſpeake but low matter, and they earthly that ſpeake from the
earth; as we read in the Goſpell of John, chap. 3.31. But contrarily, that
God remaining in heaven, and not deſcending himſelfe on earth either in his
own perſon, or in the perſon of another, hath ſpoken to us by Chriſt
ſent from heaven, as his Interpreter and meſſenger; what elſe can this
ſignifie, but that he hath ſpoken hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and that Chriſt is
far greater then Moſes? For as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the fore-cited place of
John; <hi>He that commeth from above, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all;</hi> and <hi>he that
commeth from heaven is above all.</hi> In this ſenſe therefore, that Angell
repreſenting God, muſt ſtand for God; and Chriſt muſt not be compared
with that Angell who repreſented the perſon and name of God, but with
Moſes; and the difference between Chriſt and Moſes muſt ſtand in
this, that God ſpake to Moſes on earth, but to Chriſt in heaven; and that
God ſent Moſes from the mount to the Iſraelites, but Chriſt from heaven
to Chriſtians. If this be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to any man, which yet we beleeve
to be moſt agreeable both to the truth, and to the Scripture, and to the
Text, we may ſay (which is our other anſwer to the queſtion propoſed,
and another ſenſe of the words) that by him who ſpake on earth, muſt be
underſtood that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, who in Gods name publiſhed the Law on Mount Sinai;
and by him who ſpake from Heaven, muſt be underſtood the moſt high God
himſelfe. For he that by himſelfe delivers Laws on earth, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhew that he is not the moſt high God. For the Majeſty of the moſt high
God, permits not, that the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords ſhould depart
from his inacceſſible light, and from his heavenly throne to deſcend
downe upon earth. But hee that offers himſelfe as God to be heard from
heaven, he by far greater reaſon muſt be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for God himſelfe. But
you will ſay, when did God himſelfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Goſpell from heaven? I
anſwer, This was done then, when by his voice uttered from heaven, he
teſtified that Chriſt was his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne, and therefore his
Ambaſſadour, and withall commanded us to heare him. For ſhall not God
himſelfe be thought to ſpeak to us <pb n="322" facs="tcp:61860:167"/>from heaven, when
we heare that doctrine which God himſelfe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by his voice uttered
from heaven? For although by the wiſe determination of God, the promiſcuous
multitude heard not this voice with their ears; yet it was heard and
publiſhed by them, whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is irrefragable. But in the
publiſhing of the Law was no ſuch thing. Whence it is manifeſt that even
in this ſenſe, the Authors argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wants no force. For it is a greater
crime to turne away from God, who ſpake from heaven, then from an Angell, who
ſpake on earth, though he ſuſtained the name of God. Hee turnes away from
God, and as it were turnes his backe upon him, who refuſeth either to beleeve
or obey the voice of God.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>Whoſe voice then ſhooke the earth</hi>] From
theſe words it ſeems to be gathered, that the Author by him who ſpake on
earth underſtands God himſelfe. For here he mainifeſtly attributeth to
God himſelf the ſhaking of the earth; <hi>i.</hi> of Mount Sinai, which
happened at the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Law from thence: But nothing hinders, why
this action may not be aſcribed both to God and to the Angell who in
publiſhing the Law ſuſtained the perſon of God; as likewiſe that
ſpeaking or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the oracles a little before mentioned. For the Angell
properly and immediatly did both ſhake the earth or mountaine, and alſo
ſpake; and God did it mediatly by that very Angell. But in theſe words
there is a tacit anſwer to an objection, and withall a ſtrong reaſon, why
Chriſtians muſt obey the voice of God publiſhed by Chriſt. For ſome
man might ſay, that the Law was publiſhed with great terrour, inſomuch
that the earth was ſhaken with the voice of God: whence we may eaſily
gather, what a fearfull puniſhment remaines to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakers of the Law.
To this terrour of the Law, he Author oppoſeth a far greater terror, and
ſhews that under the Goſpell matters will be far more terrible, for not
only the earth but heaven it ſelfe ſhall be ſhaken. From whence any man
may eaſily perceive, that there ſhall be no place of eſcape from Gods
puniſhments for them who have been diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent againſt the voice of the
Goſpell. For whither ſhall they flye, if the heavens themſelves which doe
encompaſſe the earth round about, ſhall be ſhaken, yea ſhall fall and
periſh; as we are taught in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe. <hi>Whoſe voice</hi>] 
<note place="margin">The thunder called the voice of God.</note>By
the voice of God wee may underſtand thoſe thunders, by whoſe cracks the
Mount quaked and trembled; for in ſeverall places of Scripture the thunder is
called the voice of God; See Job 37.4,5. and Pſal. 18.13. and Pſal. 29.
<hi>per tot. Shooke the earth</hi>] Some part of the earth, as Mount Sinai and
the plaine adjoyning. Whence it appears, that under the times of the Goſpel
there will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner of earthquake; when not only ſome one
mountaine, or ſome ſmall territory, but the whole univerſall earth
ſhall be ſhaken and broken to the loweſt foundations of it. <hi>But now
he hath promiſed ſaying.</hi> The word <hi>now</hi> doth not expreſſe
the time of the promiſe, but the <pb n="323" facs="tcp:61860:167"/>time of performance of
the thing promiſed; namely the time wherein God will ſhake both heaven and
earth. So that <hi>now</hi> muſt be referred to the times of the Goſpell,
as the ſhaking of Mount Sinai was to the times of the Law. Therefore the
minde of the Author is to ſay, Now under the times of the Goſpel, God will
ſhake not only the earth, but the heaven alſo, as he promiſed by the
Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Yet once more I ſhake, not the earth only, but alſo
heaven</hi>] This Propheſie is extant, Hag. 2.6. But the Author would
ſpeake briefly, and ſpeedily expreſſe the thing in the words of God
himſelfe; as in many paſſages St. Paul alſo doth. In the Hebrew, it is,
yet once, it is a little while; <hi>i.</hi> there yet remaines but a very
ſmall time for the fulfilling of that which God there promiſeth for the
moving of heaven and earth. But in the Greek tranſlation of the Septuagint,
whom hitherto our Author hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the teſtimonies he hath cited out
of Scripture, we read it, yet once. It may be the Septuagint did not read the
Hebrew word <hi>mead,</hi> a little while, but only <hi>achath,</hi> once. But
we need not marvell, why here the Author would rather follow the Greek
tranſlation, ſeeing it ſuiteth better with the myſticall ſenſe of
the Prophets words. For in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe, theſe words containe a
Propheſie, that it ſhould come to paſſe that God would move heaven and
earth, by raiſing up divers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and nations, who ſhould come to the
Temple at Jeruſalem, and bring with them the deſire of all Nations; that
is, that which is deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and precious among all Nations, namely ſilver
and gold, to adorne the Temple of God; as it is explicated in the words
following. But becauſe theſe words of moving heaven and earth are more
magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, then only to contain ſo narrow a ſenſe; therefore we muſt
needs conceive, that they carry ſome other more proper ſenſe; namely,
that God ſhall really ſhake heaven and earth; to which ſenſe the Greeke
tranſlation as we ſaid better agrees. For it cannot be but in a qualified
manner, that the time ſhould be called a little while, which is extended from
this Propheſie to the end of the world. If any demand, how it can be ſaid,
that God will yet once more ſhake heaven and earth, ſeeing hee never
ſhooke heaven before? Wee anſwer, It is ſaid, becauſe the earth is
there mentioned, which God did ſhake before, namely at the publiſhing of
the Law. <hi>Not the earth only, but alſo heaven</hi>] The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text hath
it ſimply, the heaven and the earth; but the Author would rather ſpeake
thus, that he might more fitly and evidently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſhaking, which
ſhall come to paſſe in the times of the Goſpel, to that ſhaking which
fell out at the publiſhing of the Law; that now under the Goſpell not the
earth only as then it was, but alſo the heaven it ſelfe ſhall be
ſhaken.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>And this word yet once more ſignifieth the
removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken</hi>] From the words yet once
more, the Author ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what manner of ſhaking ſhall come upon heaven and
earth; and <pb n="324" facs="tcp:61860:168"/>ſaith, that thoſe words doe ſignifie or
declare, the removing of the things that are ſhaken. By removing is
ſignified the abolition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of heaven and earth; for thoſe
things that are wholly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and deſtroyed, are extremely removed, not
only from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place, but from all place; See chap. 7. ver. 12.
<hi>That are ſhaken</hi> is put for, <hi>that ſhall be ſhaken,</hi> the
preſent tenſe for the future, a forme of ſpeech uſuall among the
Hebrews, eſpecially the Prophets. But how doe the words yet once more
ſignifie, that heaven and earth ſhall bee ſo ſhaken, that by their
ſhaking they ſhall be removed or aboliſhed? They ſignifie it by this
reaſon, that if heaven and earth ſhould remaine after this ſhaking, it
ſcarce ſeems poſſible, but that they muſt be once ſhaken againe,
yea it muſt neceſſarily be ſo, if, as it appears from other words of
the Prophets, heaven and earth muſt one day be aboliſhed; for then at the
leaſt, when they are aboliſhed they muſt be ſhaken, and ſo they
ſhall be ſhaken not <hi>yet once more,</hi> but twice: It is therefore
mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that theſe words <hi>yet once more,</hi> do ſignifie ſuch a
ſhaking of heaven and earth, as ſhall be accompanied with their removing or
aboliſhing. And hence alſo it is plaine that this Epiſtle was written in
Greek, ſeeing this collection of the Author is grounded only upon the Greek
tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for in the Hebrew text it cannot take place, unleſſe as we
ſaid, the word Mead <hi>a little while</hi> be expunged, which at this day is
read in all copies, and ſeems neceſſary to the literall ſenſe. <hi>As
of things that are made</hi>] He inſerts the cauſe which argues and ſhews
the removing or aboliſhing of heaven and earth, that in due time it ſhall
certainly come to paſſe; namely, becauſe they are things made. But the
words <hi>things made</hi> in this place muſt needs bee taken ſomewhat
ſtrictly. For even that heaven which ſhall not be ſhaken, was made; and
our future glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and heavenly bodies ſhall be made. Therefore things made
do in this place ſignifie thoſe things that were made of ſome groſſe
and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall matter, as are all things of this creation, as the Author
ſpeaks before, chap. 9.11. or elſe which were made of ſuch matter which
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a forraine forme beſides and beyond her naturall inclination; for
matter receiving ſuch a forme ſuffers a kinde of violence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
naturally of her owne accord inclines to the removing and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of it;
as are all things artificiall that are made by art, from which the Author
ſeems here to draw a tacit reſemblance. So the form and beauty of this
whole world was by the power of God induced into that Chaos which is
deſcribed by Moſes in the beginning of Geneſis; ſeeing therefore that
heaven and earth were made by inducing a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine forme into a groſſe
matter that was before rude, void and darke, beſide and above her naturall
capacity, therefore their forme ſhall bee ſhaken off and removed, and
conſequently they ſhall bee aboliſhed. <hi>That thoſe things which
cannot be ſhaken, may remaine.</hi>] That things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable only may remaine
alone by themſelves. Now they are, not <pb n="325" facs="tcp:61860:168"/>onely things
immutable which cannot be ſhaken, but alſo mutable which ſhall be
ſhaken. But after that all things mutable which are to be ſhaken, ſhall
be ſhaken and removed: then ſhall remaine onely things immutable which are
not to be ſhaken, nor ſhall be ſhaken. By theſe words is noted of
things mutable not the proper end for which they had being, but the event or
end of their being, whereby their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall ceaſe. And the Author added
this to ſhew, that when heaven and earth ſhall be removed or aboliſhed,
yet there ſhall be remaining a moſt ample and ſpacious manſion for the
righteous, as S. Peter alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth and calleth it, a new heaven and a
new earth wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe, 2 Pet. 3.13. But by theſe
words the Author makes way to a new argument, whereby he excites and exhorts
the Hebrewes to faith and conſtancy in the Chriſtian Religion, by
ſubjoyning.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>Wherefore we receiving a kingdome which cannot be
moved or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>] The kingdome here is both the place it ſelfe, and
alſo the bleſſed ſtate or happineſſe of them that inhabit it. And
this kingdome cannot be moved or ſhaken, not in reſpect of Gods power; for
God who is Almighty hath might and power ſufficient to move and ſhake even
that new heaven and new earth as Peter calls it: but becauſe God hath no will
ever to ſhake, yea it is his will it ſhould never be ſhaken; and
becauſe of it owne nature it is no way propenſe or inclinable to be
ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but is finally immutable; and what is ſo? of that it may well be
ſaid, that it cannot be ſhaken; in which ſence the Angels are immortall,
and ſo ſhall wee be one day. <hi>We receiving</hi>] <hi>i.</hi> accepting
and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it with our ſoule, and bearing a firme faith to the promiſes
of it, which are contained in the Chriſtian Religion; and ſo apprehending
it as it were with our hand upon Gods offer of it unto us. <hi>Let us have
grace</hi>] Have is here put for retaine or hold; unleſſe by grace here
ſome man would underſtand a thankfull minde; which ſence
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not ſo well fit the place, eſpecially ſeeing in
the holy Scriptures to have grace doth not ſignifie to have a thankfull
minde, but rather to give thanks. See 1 Tim. 1.12. and 2 Tim. 1.3. which
ſence doth not ſo well agree with the words following, <hi>Whereby wee may
ſerve God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Grace.</note>Grace therefore in this place, as
alſo elſewhere, doth rather ſignifie, either the doctrine of Chriſt
full of Gods grace, as when John ſaith, <hi>that grace came by Ieſus
Chriſt,</hi> John 1.17. where he oppoſeth grace to the Law: and S. Peter
writes, that he teſtifies, that this is <hi>the true grace of God wherein ye
ſtand,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.12. where he meanes that the doctrine which they had
received touching the grace of God, was true: Or it ſignifies the favour of
God, whereto God admitted us under the new Covenant, promiſing us eternall
life and his heavenly kingdome; which divine favour is termed by Paul, the
grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation to all men, Tit 2.11. which in the
following Chapter, ver. 4. he calls the kindeneſſe and love of God. 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61860:169"/>So that to have grace, is to retaine the doctrine of the
Goſpel which containes the grace and favour of God toward us. <hi>Whereby wee
may ſerve God acceptably</hi>] That is, according to his preſcript, if by
grace we underſtand the doctrine of Chriſt: or by his inſtinct, if wee
will have it ſignifie the favour of God. <hi>May ſerve</hi>] In the
Originall it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may worſhip:
which word ſometime in holy Scripture is taken largely and generally, for all
that honour which by holy offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we performe publiquely unto God, whether by
way of worſhip with holy reverences, or by way of ſervice, with prayers,
praiſes or thankſgivings and ſuch like; yea ſometime this word is
further ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and extended to all works of piety; becauſe under the new
Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant all pious works are accounted ſpirituall ſacrifices. But how the
word <hi>worſhip</hi> is ſometime taken more ſtrictly, and ſo oppoſed
to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and what are the differences betweene them two, we have
former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explicated, chap. 9. ver. 1. and ſee chap. 9.14.
<hi>Acceptably</hi>] Our worſhip and ſervice of God, and our workes of
piety, muſt not be done looſely after any manner: but in ſuch a manner
onely as is acceptable and pleaſing to God; becauſe all ſervice muſt be
pleaſing to the perſon to whom it is done, for otherwiſe it is
diſſervice. Therefore our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God muſt not now be
legall, by carnall ſacrifices, which while the Law was of force were not very
pleaſing unto him, (as hath beene ſhewed) but ſpirituall and
evangelicall, by holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, prayers, praiſes and thankſgivings:
neither muſt it be perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lame or may med, but entire, ſerious and
ardent. <hi>With reverence and godly feare</hi>] He ſhews the manner and way,
how to make our worſhip and ſervice acceptable and pleaſing unto God;
namely, if we worſhip and ſerve him with modeſty and reverence. In the
Greeke it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which properly
ſignifie with modeſty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Modeſty or baſhfulneſſe is an
affection whereby we feare to diſpleaſe a man, and thereby to diminiſh
his good eſteeme of us; and it extends it ſelfe to the leaſt
circumſtances that ſeeme to containe any appearance of indecency, even to
thoſe things which deſerve neither puniſhment nor blame. For modeſty
requires us to avoid all indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or if they cannot be avoyded, but either
are or have beene done, to cover them, that they may not appeare to others;
leaſt thereby wee leſſen our eſteeme with them, to whom they appeare.
But be caſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, though it be a very tender affection, yet for the
moſt part doth not incite and move us ſo vehemently, therefore to modeſty
the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor adjoynes reverence, which is a more potent affection; for
reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is an intenſe or graduated feare, when feare is in ſome degree
augmented beyond his ordinary ſtate, as Charity is an intenſe love more
then ordinary. And this reverence doth properly reſpect a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is
ſuperiour unto us, and either hath power to benefit us, or at leaſt a right
to puniſh us. For feare as it reſpects a perſon is properly 
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61860:169"/>that affection, whereby we beware of puniſhment and
other evils emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: and Reverence is this fear redoubled or graduated as wee
have ſaid. The manner therefore how to make our worſhip and ſervice of
God acceptable and pleaſing unto him, is by ſeaſoning our ſouls with
theſe two affections of Modeſty and Reverence; which are the true and firme
foundations whereupon are framed thoſe holy geſtures of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,
bowing downe, and kneeling downe to him, which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acts whereof
Gods outward worſhip doth conſiſt; as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpecified. For
if the uſe of reverend geſtures be decent and due to any perſon upon
earth, much more is the uſe of them decent and due to the moſt high God of
heaven. Seeing of all other perſons in the world, we ſhould moſt fear to
diſpleaſe God by any appearance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency in the leaſt
circumſtance; and ſeeing God above all others hath all power to benefit us,
and all right to puniſh us. In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the Author immediatly
ſubjoynes.</p>
               <p n="29">29. <hi>For our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>] Here he
adjoyns the reaſon, why we muſt worſhip and ſerve God in this
acceptable manner with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and reverence; namely, becauſe God is a
conſuming fire. 
<note place="margin">God is a fire of anger,</note>So God is called
by reaſon of his anger and wrath, wherewith he is ſo provoked by finne,
that hee growes hot and burnes againſt it; and as often as hee burnes with
wrath, he conſumes and deſtroyes ungodly men as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and as
fiercely as doth a moſt vehement fire. And it ſeems that Moſes, from whom
the Authour tooke theſe words, tooke occaſion to call God by this name,
Deut. 4.24. becauſe that God deſcended downe upon Mount Sinai in a great
flame of fire, the ſmoke whereof aſcended as the ſmoke of a furnace.
Exod. 19.18. and becauſe God ſpake out of the middeſt of the fire, that
they who heard his voyce, ſaw no other ſimilitude of him. Deut. 4.11. and
becauſe a fire proceeding from God burnt up ſome, who in his worſhip and
ſervice carried not themſelves toward him with that modeſty and reverence
that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto him. So he burnt up the two Prieſts the ſons of
Aaron, who durſt burne incenſe unto him with ſtrange fire, that was not
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and fallen from heaven. Levit. 10.2. So hee burnt up thoſe two
hundred and fifty men, who being not Prieſts, durſt approach to offer and
burne incenſe unto him. Numb. 16.35,39. Hence alſo it is that God appeared
unto Moſes in a flame of fire out of the middeſt of a buſh. Exod. 3.2.
And in the Pſalmes of David, God is ſometime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced with a fire going
before him, and burning up his enemies round about. Pſal. 97.3. And in that
viſion of Daniel, the Ancient of dayes did ſit, whoſe throne was like the
fiery flame, and his wheels like burning fire; and a fiery ſtream iſſued,
and came forth from before him. Dan. 7.9,10. Yet we muſt not think that God
doth burne with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall flames of anger. For God is rather charity as Saint
John doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. 
<note place="margin">And of love.</note>Therefore God is alwayes a
fire of love and charity towards <pb n="328" facs="tcp:61860:170"/>men, eſpecially
Chriſtians, unleſſe it be when mens ſinnes doe quench this fire of love
and charity in him, and kindle that other fire of anger and wrath. Seeing then
our God is a fire to conſume thoſe who dare preſume to worſhip or
ſerve him immodeſtly, or irreverently, or in any manner not acceptable unto
him; it therefore concernes us to bee carefull, that in all our approaches to
his worſhip or ſervice, we carry our ſelves with all modeſty and
reverence; leſt our God bee alſo unto us as a conſuming fire.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et brotherly love continue</hi>] In the former
Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee exhorted them to ſeverall duties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, as to
conſtancy in the Faith, and patience under the Croſſe, and to
Holineſſe: and alſo diſſwading from the maine contrary vices of
Apoſtacy and profanenes. Now in this Chapter hee proceeds to humane duties in
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mutuall good offices of men one toward another; beginning with
brotherly love; which is our firſt and chiefeſt degree of Charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men, particularly ſuch men as are our brethren. They are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently called
our brethren, who have one common ſpirituall father with us, and are begotten
into Chriſt from our heavenly Father, by that incorruptible ſeed, which is
the word of the Goſpel. For if the faithfull who are ſanctified, are all
brethren unto Chriſt who doth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them, as was ſhewed before,
chap. 2.11. with much more reaſon are they brethren one to another, becauſe
their mutuall reſemblances between themſelves are much more manifold. And
this brotherly love conſiſteth in the inward affect of it, and in divers
outward effects of doing good; for faith and love alſo are both dead, if they
be ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall. This love muſt <hi>continue,</hi> and remaine in that being
it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, it muſt never ceaſe to be, nor faile to be
leſſe; for hee tacitly attributes this vertue unto them, and ſuppoſing
it amongſt them already, requires the continuance of it. For he had ſpoken
before of their worke and labour of love, that they had miniſtred unto the
Saints and did miniſter. And therefore he ſeems not ſimply to exhort them
to the duty of love as if it were not yet amongſt them; but to the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it as ſuppoſing it, amongſt them already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be not forgetfull to entertaine ſtrangers</hi>]
The ſecond good office is that of hoſpitality. Hoſpitality is but love
and charity carryed upon another object, when our love is not reſtrained to
our acquaintance only whom wee know; but enlarged towards ſtrangers in
generall whom we know not, whether they be our brethren or not. And it
conſiſteth in receiving ſtrangers into our houſes, and entertaining
them will all good offices of humanity and courteſie, eſpecially according
to our abilities and their neceſſities. And as hoſpitality muſt be
exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed toward all ſtrangers, ſo eſpecially and in the firſt place
toward Chriſtians who are our brethren, and chiefly to thoſe of them that
are exiles and become ſtrangers for the cauſe of Chriſt and his Religion.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61860:171"/>And to this hoſpitality may be referred our humanity
toward the poor, by inviting them to our houſes, and cheering them in a kinde
and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable manner. And of hoſpitality we muſt <hi>not be forgetfull
i.</hi> We muſt not neglect it. For thoſe things that we forget, we alſo
neglect, or as we have ſaid before, wee take no care for them: the contrary
whereof we ſhall ſee in the verſe following. <hi>For thereby ſome have
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Angels unawares</hi>] He commends hoſpitality, and moves us to
the exerciſe of it, in regard that thereby ſome have entertained An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
unawares. He hath reference to the hiſtory of Abraham and Lot, whereof both
were wondrous hoſpitable, and carefull to receive and entertaine ſtrangers
into their houſes, and both unawares, happened upon Angels ſent from God,
carrying themſelves in the ſhape of men, which they received into their
houſes. So that by the hoſpitality of <hi>ſome,</hi> namely of Abraham
and Lot, it came to paſſe, that they received and entertained Angels, not
knowing them to bee Angels then when they received them. For if they had
evidently knowne them to bee Angels, it had been no marvell, that they invited
them into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or tents, for this they might well have done, though
otherwiſe they had not been hoſpitable. For who is ſo inhoſpitable, but
if he thinke he may procure Angels to accept of his entertainment, will delay
to invite them, when he findes them at his doore, though indeed this were no
hoſpitality at all? for he that invites Angels muſt needs know, that Angels
can be in no neceſſity to ſtand in need of entertainment; which
hoſpitality alway ſuppoſeth in the ſtranger that ſhe receiveth. 
<note place="margin">The three men ſeen of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>From
theſe words of the Author it is manifeſt, how vainly they are miſtaken,
who thinke that the three men who were ſeen and invited of Abraham, Gen.
18.2. were the perſons of the holy Trinity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaw three
and worſhipped but one, calling him, My Lord, therefore they gather, that
Abraham believed, that thoſe three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were one God. Theſe men
perceive not, upon what a fallacious conjecture they relye in matters of ſo
high moment. For this divine Author doth openly declare and teſtifie that
they were Angels, and not three perſons of the Deity; which if they had been,
he might ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have commended hoſpitality with a far higher encomium of
praiſe, and have ſaid, that by reaſon of that vertue, not Angels, but the
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Deity received entertainment. And we deſire leave to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of theſe men, what they thinke, whether Abraham, when hee ſaw
thoſe three perſons and worſhipped one of them inviting him into his
tent, did then certainly know that he entertained the perſons of the ſacred
Trinity, or not know it? If they affirme the firſt, that hee did know it,
then we further demand of them, why Abraham uſed them as men? why he
dreſſed meat and cauſed it to be ſet before them, and exhibited other
offices of courteſie to them, which are uſually done unto men? was he ſo
ignorant of things, that he knew not, that God <pb n="331" facs="tcp:61860:171"/>wanted no
ſuch entertainment? And why doth this Author ſay that he entertained men
<hi>unawares?</hi> For what can this ſignifie elſe, but that he believed
them to be men? Did hee who did not ſo much as imagine them to be Angels,
believe them to be perſons of the Deity? But if for the ſecond point
theſe men confeſſe, as the truth is, and as this Author clearly teacheth,
that Abraham ſuppoſed that he ſaw and invited no other perſons but men,
with what reaſon doe they gather, that becauſe he ſaw three and
worſhipped one, therefore he believed, that they were one God diſtinct in
three perſons? Did he therefore believe it, becauſe he did not ſo much as
imagine it? But you will ſay, why then did he worſhip one, ſeeing he
ſaw three? without all doubt he therefore did it, becauſe one of them
carried himſelfe ſo, as ſeeming greater &amp; worthier then the reſt,
and was eminent amongſt them. And ſurely one of them only is called
Jehovah, and is cleerly diſtinguiſhed from both the other. In the 18.
Chapter of Geneſis, compare the 17. verſe and ſo forth, and the laſt
verſe, with the firſt verſe of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following, where the two
other Angels went to Lot in Sodome. For this may be a ſufficient argument,
that from this one point of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping one, the unity of a common
eſſence among them cannot bee collected; ſeeing Lot worſhipped alſo
the other two, bowing himſelfe with his face toward the ground, and called
them joyntly, My Lords, Gen. 19.1,2. But if that one at Abrahams tent carried
himſelfe for a divine perſon, why is he alone, both worſhipped of
Abraham, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Jehovah in the Scripture? Were not the other perſons
worthy of the ſame honour, and of the ſame name? But if that one went for
the divine and commune eſſence, where ſhall be the third Perſon of the
Deity? Did therefore Abraham worſhip the divine Eſſence, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the
divine Perſons? or did one carry himſelfe for the Eſſence, and for a
Perſon alſo? And why not the reſt alſo, if the divine Eſſence were
equally commune to them all? Euſebius in his firſt booke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that
this one Perſon was the Sonne of God, becauſe that after Abraham knew him,
he is called Lord and God. For hee will not have him to be the moſt high God,
becauſe to him it is not incident, to undergoe ſuch a change, as to
aſſume a ſtrange ſhape, and converſe with men under it. (Neither may
we think (to inſert this by the way) that thoſe fathers who lived before
and about the times of the Nicene Councel, and the whole Church in generall
held this opinion of God, to believe, that the Sonne is that one moſt high
God who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For they were far of another minde, who yet if in
theſe times they ſhould appeare, would now of an univerſall Councel be no
leſſe condemned then they then condemned others.) On the other ſide,
Euſebius ſeeing that the name of Lord and God was given to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he imagined that he could not poſſibly be any other but the Son of God,
conſubſtantiall to his Father as he thought, and therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker 
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61860:172"/>of his Fathers divine Name. So multiple and various is
errour, that when ſhe hath once ſtrayed from the path of truth, wanders
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, and findes no end of erring, and beleeves none that would
direct her; for there is no blindneſſe ſo incurable as that of the minde;
becauſe it perſwades the ſoule that ſhe wants no ſight but ſees
moſt cleerely. But Euſebius might have ſufficiently knowne and beene
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if by no meanes elſe, yet from this one place of this Author, that
this perſon and the reſt entertained by Abraham were indeed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. But
you will ſay, why then is that perſon called Jehovah which is the proper
Name of God himſelfe? The reaſon is, becauſe he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe for
God himſelfe, at Gods will and command. For ſuch an one (as we heard
before,) was that Angel who firſt appeared to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the buſh, and
afterward at Mount Sinai in ſuch high Majeſty; both which as it appeares
plainely from Scripture were Angels,

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Remember them that are in bonds</hi>] To remember
in this place, is to have a care; for of whom we have a care, them we are wont
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to remember. And the ſence of this remembring here is all one with the
negation of the contrary in the former verſe, where he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, that
they ſhould not be forgetfull; becauſe not to forget, is to remember.
<hi>Them that are in bonds;</hi> namely for Chriſts and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels
ſake; for though many were in bonds for other cauſes as for crimes and
offences, yet the multitude of thoſe that were in bonds for Chriſt, made
farre the greater number. For afflictions and perſe quati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo
incident to the truth of the Goſpel, that ſhe produceth an army of bondmen,
wherein the fore-runner of Chriſt was alſo the fore-runner: for John
Baptiſt ſuffered both bonds and death: but wee muſt looke upon Chriſt
as the Generall of this Army, who led the way by the Croſſe, as this Author
requires us, chap. 12.2. Of the like bloudy cup Stephen dranke and James; Peter
alſo lyes ſleeping in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betweene two ſouldiers bound with two
chaines, Acts 12 6. Paul and Silas are thruſt into the inner priſon at
Philippi, and have their feet made faſt in the ſtocks, Acts 16.24. Yea Paul
was for many yeares ſo familiarly acquainted with chaines and bonds, that he
makes it his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to be the priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt; for ſo he
ſtiles himſelfe in <pb n="333" facs="tcp:61860:172"/>ſeverall of his Epiſtles. And
this Author doth acknowledge himſelfe to be in bonds, and that therein
theſe Hebrewes had compaſſion on him, chap. 10.34. Yet in this place his
intention is not, that they ſhould remember him alone: but he ſpeakes in
the plurall number for their charity in generall to all that are in bonds.
<hi>As being bound with them</hi>] He ſhews how carefully we ſhould
remember thoſe that are in bonds; namely by thinking our ſelves to be in
the ſame ſtate and condition with them; and therefore having aſſumed
their perſons upon us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we would have done by our brethren and
companions to us in the like caſe, the ſame we ſhould carefully doe unto
them in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. 
<note place="margin">Commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>And from theſe words
it appeares that the third duty or good office whereto the Author doth exhort
them, is commiſeration or compaſſion; which though he name not in
expreſſe termes, yet his words do tacitly imply it. For commiſeration is
but love and charity varied yet upon another object, when our love is not
reſtrained onely to our brethren, or to ſtrangers, which (as was ſhewed
in the former verſe) is hoſpitality; but when the bowels of our love are
enlarged to all perſons in miſery, in what relation ſoever they ſtand
unto us; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we aſſume unto our ſelves and ſeele in our
foules the like paſſions that be in them, of ſuffering and being bound
with them; for then our charity becomes true compaſſion or commiſeration.
<hi>And them which ſuffer adverſitie</hi>] In the Greek it is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is a generall word that
may be extended to all kinds of afflictions; or if it be reſtrained it
commonly ſignifies thoſe that are ſicke, or ſuffer bodily paines. And
the adverſity of ſickneſſe or paine is a ſore miſery, that doth
juſtly require our commiſeration. <hi>As being your ſelves alſo in the
body.</hi>] Here he ſhews a reaſon or motive why we ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate
thoſe that are ſick and pained in body; namely, becauſe was our ſelves
are compaſſed with a body of infirmity ſubject unto ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and
paines. For ſeeing wee are men, we muſt therefore conſider that no humane
infirmity is exempted from us; and thereupon ſeame to commiſerate other
perſons in their ſickneſſe, as if the like miſery were already or
ſhortly may be upon our owne bodies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Mariage is honourable in all, and the bed
undeſiled</hi>] The fourth duty or vertue whereto he exhorts them is
Chaſtity, by avoyding the vice of luſt and uncleanneſſe. The ſpeech
of the Author is here illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticall or defective, for in the Greek there is no
verbe, <hi>is.</hi> Yet we muſt needs underſtand ſome verbe, either
indicative <hi>is,</hi> as here our and moſt vulgar Tranſlations have it,
Mariage is honourable, and the bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed is honourable: Or rather wee
ſhould underſtand a verbe impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, let. <hi>Let</hi> mariage
<hi>be</hi> honourable, and <hi>let</hi> the bed <hi>be</hi> undefiled;
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the former verſes in this Chapter are delivered in the
impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mood; as <hi>Let brotherly love continue,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Be not
forgetfull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Remember them that are in
bonds,</hi> ver. 3. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="334" facs="tcp:61860:173"/>the verſes
following alſo runne in the ſame imperative Mood; as <hi>Let your
converſation be without covetouſneſſe,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Remember them
which have the rule over you,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Be not carried about with
diverſe and ſtrange doctrines,</hi> ver. 9. &amp;c. Thirdly, becauſe the
fith verſe next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this is without any verbe in the Greek; and yet
the Tranſlators doe unanimouſly ſupply it with a verbe not indicative,
ſaying, your converſation <hi>is</hi> without covetouſneſſe: but
imperative, <hi>Let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be ſo.</hi> Laſtly, becauſe the
contents of this Chapter ſeeme not to be matter of Doctrine, but of
Exhortation; whoſe Mood is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative, moving us (as we have ſaid) to
ſeverall duties and good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If then wee underſtand theſe words
Indicatively, by ſupplying them with the verbe <hi>is;</hi> Then the ſence
will be, That mariage is in all or among men of all ſorts and ranks a thing
honeſt, and by it onely the bed is undefiled; ſo that a man may live in
mariage with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of piety and honeſty; contrary to what is done in
fornication and adultery. But if we underſtand them imperatively or
preceptively by ſupplying them with the verbe <hi>let be; Let</hi> mariage
<hi>be</hi> honourable. Then the ſence will be. Let mariage bee preſerved
in it due honour, and let the meanes to preſerve it ſo, be, by keeping the
bed undefiled from adulteries; for nothing is more diſhonourable to a maried
perſon, then to have his bed ſtained and defiled by the uncleanneſſe of
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is done in every adultery; for the nature of adultery is here
modeſtly defined to be the defiling of anothers bed. The words <hi>in
all</hi> may be referred either to things or perſons. If wee referre them to
things, the ſence will be, that mariage be in every thing obſerved
honeſtly and chaſtly, and that the bed be not polluted with any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
or ſtrange luſt. But if wee referre <hi>in all</hi> to perſons; the
ſence will be, that mariage muſt be had in honour and eſteeme among all
perſons of all ſexes; that no perſon ſhould ſo deſpiſe it as to
preſume or dare to invade anothers bed, whether he be a ſingle perſon or
mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For all perſons ought to have ſuch an opinion of mariage, as to
eſteeme it a thing ſacred and not to be polluted; for he that doth
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and tranſgreſſeth the Laws of mariage, by defiling his bed
and body with a ſtranger, incurres a heavy penalty, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
will one day execute upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whoremongers and adulterers God will judge</hi>] Here he
brings a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Reaſon, whereby hee would perſwade us to the former
dutie of honouring mariage by our honeſty and chaſtity; namely, becauſe
God will ſhew a judgement upon whoremongers and adulteres, who are the maine
tranſgreſſours againſt mariage to violate and diſhonour it; for to
the honeſty of mariage and the chaſtitie of the bed, he oppoſeth
whoredome and adulterie, as a bed polluted and defiled. For mariage is
diſhonoured and diſgraced two wayes chiefly; firſt by whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who
deſpiſe it and will not marry, and ſecondly by adulterers, 
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61860:173"/>who violate and affront mariage. And the judgement which
God hath already denounced, and will certainly execute upon whormongers and
adulterers, is, that they ſhall not inherit the kingdome of heaven. See Gal.
5. verſe 19.20.21. and Epheſ. 5.5. And the Author makes God the Judge to
condemne and puniſh theſe whoremongers and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to the end they
might thinke and conſider, that though they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their wickedneſſes
ſecretly, and many times eſcape the eyes and judgements of men, yet they
ſhall not evade the avenging hand of God, and in vaine they deale warily, if
they live not chaſtly. For God doth ſeverely perſecute uncleannes,
eſpecially in them whom he hath ſeaſoned with the knowledge of Chriſt,
ſequeſtred from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and worldly men, and accepted as perſons
ſacred to himſelfe. If therefore men would avoide this judgement of God in
the loſſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, let them avoid the defiling ſins of
whoredome and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 
<note place="margin">Of ſingle life.</note>Concerning celibate or
ſingle life, here is nothing ordained; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although a chaſte
celibate be purer and holier then mariage, yet the neceſſitie of it is not
commanded or impoſed upon any man by the ſacred Scripture: But Chriſt
doth only perſwade it, yet onely to them, who can containe themſelves. Mat.
19.11,12. and Paul more amply and openly. 1. Cor. 7. ver. 8, 26. and thence to
the end of the chapter. Here therefore we muſt walke in a middle way. And as
mariage muſt not be detruded into the number of fornications and
uncleanneſſes, as ſome anciently did, who eſteemed mariage nothing
elſe, but a kind of licenced whoredom: ſo again on the other ſide it
muſt not be equalled to a chaſte celibate, which the Scripture clearly
prefers before mariage, as containing more puritie and holineſſe in it. But
as wee ſaid, it muſt be exacted from no man; leſt while we affect extream
puritie, either we our ſelves fall into miſchiefes and uncleanneſſes,
or precipitate others into them, who aſpire either to the glory of celibate,
or to other vertues and offices incloſed with the neceſſitie of celibate.
Whatſoever is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, honeſt, and undefiled, as the Authour here
teſtifies of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that muſt bee granted free to any man,
eſpecially if there ariſe a weightie cauſe, as in this caſe there may,
to cut off all occaſions of whoredomes, adulteries, and other defilements.
And they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre from mariage thoſe which burne as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes, doe all one, as if a man who cannot hinder the diſeaſe, doth yet
forbid to uſe the remedy; for what elſe can follow upon this, but a
ſoarer ſickneſſe? For mariage is the remedie for burning and luſt;
which when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to them that burne, the iſſue will be, that at
length they fall into a farre worſe diſeaſe, and runne into uncleane and
unlawfull pleaſures. Beſides, it detracts much from the dignity of
celibate, if it ceaſe to be voluntary, and be forced by law, and ariſe not
from free-will. But to returne to the words of the Authour. Whoredome is
betweene thoſe parties that are both free from the bond of mariage: but
adulterie is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <pb n="336" facs="tcp:61860:174"/>parties, whereof either both, or
one of them at leaſt is married. Anciently under the old Teſtament, when
husbands might have more wives then one, it was not adultery for a married man
to lie with a ſingle woman unmarried, but onely whoredome. But under the new
Teſtament, where this licenciouſnes of husbands is limited by the law of
Chriſt, and reſtrained to the company of one wife onely; adultery is
committed as well on the husbands part, as on the wives; as may eaſily
appeare by the words of Chriſt. Matth. 19.9. where he ſaith,
<hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall put away his wife except it be for fornication, and
ſhall marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, committeth adultery.</hi> Which certainely is not,
becauſe of the mariage-bond (for that of it ſelfe is rather to avoid
uncleaneſſe then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it) but abſolutely and ſimply, becauſe
having a wife before hee preſumes to lie with another woman, when by Law the
former woman ceaſeth not to bee his wife, becauſe his divorce was illegall
and a nullitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Let your converſation be without
covetouſneſſe.</hi>] The fifth dutie whereto he exhorts, is
Contentedneſſe, by avoiding the vice of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, which here
the Author diſſwades next after uncleanneſſe in the former verſe. For
theſe two vices of uncleannes and covetouſnes, love to goe together, or one
to follow cloſe upon another; for we finde them this coupled and joyned in
ſeveral paſſages of the holy Scriptures; as the two grand vices of the
world, that are moſt pernicious, and yet moſt common. See Epheſ. 5.3,5.
and Coloſ. 3.5. and 1. Theſ. 4.5,6. and divers other places of the
Prophets. Wherefore of all other vices, theſe two unto Chriſtians ought to
be moſt odious, as being ſo joyntly and fully cryed out againſt in the
Scriptures. The word for <hi>Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Greeke is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which either ſignifies a
cuſtome and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; although it bee not uſually put in the ſingular
number for a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in the

<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies the manners; or
cuſtomary actions of a man. Or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
ſignifies the meanes and way of getting our livelihood. Both theſe
ſenſes come to one, and both agree to the point propoſed. For both our
manners and our meanes of getting our livelihood muſt bee free from all
covetouſneſſe and love of money. Now covetouſneſſe is an inordinate
deſire and endeavour of worldly goods; or as Saint Paul deſcribes it, 1.
Tim. 6.9,10. It is a deſire to be rich; for what at the ninth verſe hee
tearmed a deſire to be rich, hee afterward at the tenth verſe, cals the
love of money or covetouſneſſe; and withall he ſets this brand upon it,
that it is the nurſery or root of all evil. <hi>And be content with ſuch
things as you have.</hi>] To covetouſneſſe hee oppoſeth
conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe as the contrary dutie and remedy againſt it. So doth
alſo S. Paul. 1. Tim. 6.8. Where he limits our contentedneſſe only to
food and raiment; ſaying, <hi>Having food and raiment, let us be therewith
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>] He is content with the things he hath for the preſent, who
doth <pb n="337" facs="tcp:61860:174"/>ſo reſt ſatisfied with that eſtate he hath,
though it be meane and ſmall, that hee is neither querulous to complaine for
the preſent, nor ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to care and doubt for the future, though he
foreſee not proviſion of food and raiment for the time to come; becauſe
he truſteth wholly upon God, and in caſes doubtfull conſtantly hopes for
help and aide from him. To a minde thus compoſed it is not repugnant, if thou
art poore, to deſire and ſeeke more, ſo thou deſire and ſeeke it
moderatly, and whether thou get more or not, art alwayes of an equall and
indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent minde, and canſt ſay with Tobias ſpeaking to his ſonne.
<hi>Fear not my ſonne though we are made poore, for thou haſt much wealth
if thou fear God, and depart from all ſinne, and doe that which is pleaſing
in his ſight.</hi> Tobit 4.21. But wealthy thou wilt never be, if thou
diſtruſteſt God, and with an anxious and reſtleſſe
carefulneſſe, giveſt thy ſelfe wholly to gaine wealth; if thou neglect
the worſhip of God, the ſerious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care of thy ſalvation,
beneficence to the poor and needy accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy eſtate, if thou trace the
by pathes of thriving by unjuſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without regard to the offices and
duties of pietie and equitie. And theſe are the bounds wherewith S. Paul
defines contentednes, in having food and raiment, as was before noted. A godly
man doth neither refuſe more, nor overmuch deſire it. See Phil. 4.11,12.
Therefore this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may well agree with labour, induſtry, and parcimony,
by which meanes if God give his bleſſing, wee may raiſe our ſelves from
pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, uſing withall a due meane and convenient meaſure. <hi>For he
hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Here hee gives
the reaſon why we ſhould be content with what we have, without complaint or
anxity for the time to come; and hee drawes his reaſon from the promiſe of
God unto us; becauſe God hath ſaid, hee will never leave us nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
us. A reaſon very effectuall and of great moment to perſwade us; for why
ſhould wee be anxious and carefull, when wee have ſo great a perſon as
God for our Patron and Protectour, who the more to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us, hath engaged
himſelfe by his promiſe, to provide for us? for <hi>he hath ſaid it.</hi>
There is a great Emphaſis in the pronoune He like to that of
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hee who is the moſt high God,
the Authour and Guardian of all things, and the Patron and Saviour of man.
Whence it appears how firme and certaine his ſuccour is to them that are in
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>] In the
ſecond mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this clauſe, there is in the Greeke a moſt ſtrong
negation of Gods deſertion, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Here is a triple negation, that thereby we might ſo much the more ſecure
our ſelves, that the time ſhall never come, wherein God will forſake us.
The words are the ſaying of God to Joſhua the captaine of the Iſraelites.
Joſhua 1.5. Which ſaying, every Chriſtian as being joyned to God in a
nearer bond, then ever Joſhua was, may well apply unto himſelfe;
eſpecially ſeeing the aſſiſtance and ſuccour promiſed in theſe
words to Joſhua, <pb n="338" facs="tcp:61860:175"/>was onely in reference to the ſafety
and benefit of the people of Iſrael, to whom he was leader.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>So that we may boldly ſay</hi>] He expreſſeth
the effect or fruit, which Gods promiſe of never failing to helpe and
ſuccour us, doth or ought to produce in us; which effect is wholly oppoſite
to anxiety and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for the future. And it is two-fold. The
firſt is a full and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine confidence and perſwaſion of Gods helpe;
the other conſequent hereto, is the confeſſion of the mouth and as it
were a glorying, That God will alwayes be ready to helpe us; which he
preſently expreſſeth in the words of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 118.6.
<hi>The Lord is my helper and I will not feare what man ſhall doe unto
me.</hi> The words here cited by the Author, doe plainely declare, that God
will be an helper and ſuccour unto us, not onely in time of want, but alſo
in time of danger; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times we feare dangers more then poverty or want;
and we gather wealth not onely to defend us againſt poverty, but to guard us
againſt men and dangers. And therefore both out health and our wealth is in
God; who will ſo protect us, that neither poverty nor dangers ſhall
oppreſſe us; unleſſe ſometime it be his good pleaſure to exerciſe
and make triall of our faith by hunger, thirſt, nakedneſſe and want of
all things, by dangers, priſons, torments and a fearefull death. But then in
ſuch a caſe no riches will advantage us: but may much hinder us, for they
may eaſily ſo worke upon us, that for love of them we will not willingly
and readily follow Chriſt, when hee would leade us through craggy and rough
wayes. For poverty makes Chriſtians nimble and light, but riches are a
burden. <hi>What man ſhall doe.</hi> He op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth man unto God, that by
this oppoſition it may appeare what a ſtrong guard God is unto us againſt
men; and what little reaſon wee have to feare men, when we have God for our
protector. For how great and mighty is the Lord, and what a worme is man?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Remember them that have the rule over you</hi>] The
ſixth precept or duty whereto he excites them, is to imitate and follow their
leaders and rulers in the Chriſtian Religion. Theſe leaders and rulers were
ſuch as had taught them by their doctrine and example of life, going before
them in the wayes of truth and godlineſſe; or as the Author here
deſcribes them, <hi>Who have ſpoken unto you the word of God</hi>] Namely
Gods word of the Goſpel; ſuch as firſt of all preached the Goſpel unto
them; among whom without doubt were ſome of the Apoſtles, and thoſe who
next ſucceeded the firſt. <hi>Whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end
of their converſation</hi>] Having deſigned out the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhould
be remembred, namely their rulers who had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel unto them;
here he expreſſeth and ſpecifieth the matter wherein or for what their
rulers ſhould be remembred; namely, for their faith and for their
converſation. They muſt conſider and follow the faith and doctrine which
their rulers delivered unto them; and <pb n="339" facs="tcp:61860:175"/>they muſt
conſider and follow the converſation of their life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and they
muſt conſider the end of their faith and converſation, what iſſue and
event both theſe had. How they were not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the end in the
faith and doctrine which they delivered, and in the converſation and
holineſſe of life which they practiſed: but many of them fealed the
verity of their holy Religion with their bloud by a bitter death. Theſe are
the things that after due conſideration had, they muſt labour to follow, by
adhering to that faith and doctrine whereto they adhered, with the ſame
firmity and conſtancy that they did: and by profeſſing it ſo
effectually, that by vertue thereof we doe not onely abſtaine from all manner
of vice, to live holily in the ſight of God; but alſo not decline to dye
for the truth of it. See the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and way whereby we muſt preſerve the
memory of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of this life; not by erecting Tombes and
Temples unto them at vaſt charges; not by conſecrating ſtatues and Images
unto them; not by powring out our prayers unto them or their Images: For
theſe wayes are either ſuperfluous and ſuperſtitious, or elſe
unlawfull and impious: But we muſt alwayes remember their holy ordinances,
and the courſe of their lives ſutable to thoſe ordinances, diligently
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to follow them, by imitating and expreſſing their examples in
our practice. For this way will leade us unto holineſſe and
happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day
and for ever</hi>] Becauſe he had before ſaid, they muſt remember their
rulers, following their faith and conſidering their converſation; wherein
(as we ſaid) was alſo included, that they ſhould alwayes preſerve and
retaine the doctrine which they had heard from them, and not decline any thing
from it; Therefore now hee ſhews that the doctrine of Chriſt both for our
knowledge and practiſe is unchangeable; that in no tract of time or age, any
change muſt be made therein, either by adding, ſubtracting or altering any
thing therein. Jeſus Chriſt, namely conſidered both in reſpect of his
office and in reſpect of his doctrine; or rather the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it ſelfe of
Chriſt, by way of Metonymy, the efficient or Author for the act or effect, as
often elſewhere. <hi>The ſame yeſterday and to day and for ever</hi>]
Chriſt and his doctrine is the very ſame, conſtant to it ſelfe, and
nothing either changed or changeable, for it is the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in
reference to all times, whether paſt, preſent, or to come. For as the word
<hi>to day</hi> ſignifies the time preſent; ſo <hi>yeſterday</hi> notes
the time paſt; yet not long paſt, but lately a while ſince; as then was
the firſt time of publiſhing the Goſpel upon earth. For among the people
of God, <hi>yeſterday</hi> ſignifies the time indefinitely and lately
paſt, which vulgarly we expreſſe by <hi>the other day,</hi> See Gen.
31.2. and Exod. 4.10. and Exod. 5.14. and 1 Sam. 20.27. and 2 Sam. 15.20. and 2
King. 9.26. and Job 8.9. And the word <hi>for ever</hi> ſignifies the time to
come, not for ſome part of it, but for all parts of it ſucceſſively,
while any time ſhall <pb n="340" facs="tcp:61860:176"/>be laſting. So that nothing is,
hath beene, or ſhall be changed in the doctrine of Chriſt; as it was of
late when it was firſt delivered and publiſhed to the world, ſo it is now
at this preſent, &amp; ſo it ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for all times to come
throughout all ages: for though the world ſhould laſt never ſo long, yet
to the worlds end there ſhal be no change nor alteration in the doctrin of
the Goſpel; not that there wil want men, who ſhall labour to corrupt and
change the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or ſhall indeed corrupt
and change it in divers particulars (for that ſuch men there ſhall be, wee
may gather by the words of the Author in the next verſe following, wherein he
warnes them of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the purity of the Goſpel, and being carried
about with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and ſtrange doctrines) but that the doctrine of
Chriſt conſidered in it ſelfe, and as it containes the truth and will of
God; is no way ſubject to any mutation or innovation. Whence it appeares what
we are to thinke of thoſe doctrines and opinions, which have riſen ſince
the firſt times of the Church of Chriſt, and were never delivered by the
Apoſtles themſelves, nor ever received in the primitive Church. Of theſe
we are to thinke as the Apoſtle hath left it written, <hi>Though we or an
Angel from heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that we have
preached unto you, let him be accurſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now
againe, if any man preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that yee have
received, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8,9.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange
doctrines</hi>] The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth precept or duty whereto he exhorts them,
although it were in a manner comprehended in the former verſe, where a ground
was laid that will neceſſarily inferre it. And it is, that they ſhould
not ſuffer them to be perſwaded to diverſe and new doctrines, which were
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretofore delivered unto them by their teachers and rulers in the
Chriſtian Religion, nor were agreeable to the rule of the truth delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Diverſe doctrines in this place are they, which are different and diverſe
from themſelves and oppoſite one to another. As if he had ſaid. In
matters concerning Chriſtian Religion (for of theſe onely he ſpeaketh)
ſee that ye receive not one while this opinion, and another while that; for
to doe ſo, is their faſhion, who are not yet exerciſed in the knowledge
of the truth, or not yet ſufficiently confirmed in it. He addes the word
<hi>ſtrange,</hi> that by this meanes they might diſcerne thoſe
doctrines. For ſtrange doctrines are new doctrines, neither delivered by the
firſt publiſhers of the Chriſtian verity, nor conſonant to thoſe that
were firſt delivered, whoſe very countenance and habit, as I may ſay,
doth eaſily diſcover them to be none of the Apoſtles doctrines, as we
ſee it fall out with perſons that are ſtrangers. With theſe diverſe
and ſtrange doctrines they muſt <hi>not be carried about;</hi> which as it
ſeemes is a Metaphor taken from ſhips and veſſels at ſea, which are
many times agitated and toſſed diverſe wayes by diverſe and contrary
winds. <pb n="341" facs="tcp:61860:176"/>Which ſimilitude St. Paul alſo uſeth, where
he ſaith, That <hi>wee hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth bee no more children toſſed too and
fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men and
cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lye in wait to deceive,</hi> Epheſ.
4.14. And wee are carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a doctrine as with a winde, when wee give
as it were the ſailes of our ſoules unto it, by embracing and following it.
<hi>For it is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace, and
not with meats.</hi> To his generall exhortation he ſubjoynes a ſpeciall
reaſon or motive. Whence it appeares that the Author in this generall
exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had chiefly a ſpeciall reference to ſome particular
doctrines, whereto the Hebrews bore a great propenſion of minde, which could
hardly be any other then ſuch as were drawne from the Law of Moſes. For
there could be no danger that they would decline from the purity of Chriſtian
diſcipline, to any other but the ordinances of the Law. And in the firſt
place, the ſacrifices and offerings which were uſually made under the Law;
if not, to believe that by them they obtained the expiation of their ſinnes,
for they had been ſufficiently taught already under the Goſpell that the
ſinnes of all beleevers were fully purged by the bloud of Chriſt: yet at
leaſt, that they might enjoy the feaſts of thoſe ſacrifices, and
ſociety with the reſt of the Jewes, communicating with them in their
Religion, and conſequently in their whole ſtate; which thing they
ſuppoſed might be permitted them eſpecially in their ſacrifices and
peace-offerings, as being not offered for ſinne, but either upon vow, or upon
ſome other voluntary devotion; and which ſeemed not to be excluded by the
ſacrifice of Chriſt, which was only expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſinne. For even in
thoſe ſacrifices except the holocauſt or whole burnt-offerings, part went
to the honour of God, as the bloud and the fat, part to the Prieſt, and part
to the uſe of thoſe that offered, whereto they invited one another in the
court of the Temple, and did eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feaſting and cheering themſelves
before the Lord. Therefore this holy feaſting together, being an argument of
their communion with the reſt of the people, might flatter their ſoules,
and make them deſire the legall ſacrifices and offerings, if not all, yet
at leaſt the peace-offerings, and take it heavily that they were reſtrained
from them, and withall from the ſociety of the Jews Common-wealth, as
unworthy perſons, becauſe of the Chriſtian Religion, eſpecially as it
ſtood pure and refined from the legall ceremonies. As alſo, to be inhibited
from the Religion and ſtate of the Jew, was troubleſome to the fleſh, for
to enjoy both was very pleaſing carnally; and to eat the holy meats before
the Lord had a ſhew of piety, and might ſeem ſomewhat to prevaile with
God. With this error therefore, whereinto they were prone to fall, the Author
meets two wayes; and withall declares what ſacrifices and what offerings
whether for ſinne or peace wee ſhould offer unto God, namely ſpirituall
ſacrifices, wherein there is no uſe of eating. For <pb n="342" facs="tcp:61860:177"/>though many are of opinion that the Author here treats of not
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that difference of meats which was ſo preciſely and carefully
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained under the Law, yet we think otherwiſe for theſe reaſons: 1.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Author ſeems to recall them from the uſe of meats and not to
grant the uſe of them; for he ſpeaks not of a liberty to eat, but of a
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to abſtaine; and he oppoſeth grace to meats, becauſe it is
good the heart ſhould be eſtabliſhed or refreſhed or recreated not with
meats but with grace: but the heart is not recreated with meats not eaten but
eaten; therefore grace is here oppoſed not to the uſe of meats, but to
abſtinence from them. 2. Becauſe the following reaſon propoſed ver. 10,
11. doth openly treat of that eating of the ſacrifices; which to Chriſtians
was not convenient; neither can this reaſon by any meanes be applied to the
aboliſhing of the difference of meats. 3. Becauſe from the words ſpoken
here; the Author infers at the 15. verſe (as the particle <hi>therefore</hi>
ſhewes) that wee muſt offer ſpirituall ſacrifices by Chriſt. Whence
it may be gathered, that by theſe words that ſervice and eating of
ſacrifices anciently ordained under the Law, is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and
condemned; for that from this is rightly and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred: but is not
inferred from the aboliſhing of the difference of meats. But now let us
conſider and weigh the Authors argument. The firſt way is contained in
theſe words by way of prevention. For they who deſired thoſe ſacrifices
and holy banquets, might ſay, It is good to eſtabliſh the heart with
meats, that is, to recreate it, after the Hebrew phraſe, who call recreating
of the heart, eſtabliſhing of it; See Gen. 18.5. where Abraham invited the
three men, of whom we trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, to eſtabliſh their heart with a
morſell of bread; that is, to take ſome little repaſt. The Author ſeems
to have reference to the words of Moſes. Deut. 12.18. who ſpeaking of
eating holy things, ſaith, <hi>And thou ſhalt rejoyce before the Lord thy
God in all that thou putteſt thine hand unto.</hi> To this objection the
Author anſwers by oppoſing unto it a greater and more excellent good, by
ſaying, <hi>It is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace,
not with meats.</hi> As if he had ſaid, To eſtabliſh the heart with meats
is not ſo good, but to doe it with grace is truly good as he preſently
demonſtrates. By grace he meane; that grace of God, which is revealed and
offered unto men in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, conſiſting in a plenary remiſſion
of the guilt and paine of all our ſinnes, even the moſt heinous; in a
perfect expiation of all our ſinnes by the ſacrifice and offering of
Chriſt; in looſing from the neckes of men that yoke of the ceremoniall law,
wherein are contained the ordinances for carnall ſacrifices; in juſtifying
us not by merit of works, but by faith; and after juſtification in giving us
poſſeſſion of eternall life in due time. This is the thing, the good
thing, wherewith not our bodies, but our hearts and ſoules are in a
wonderfull manner recreated and refreſhed; and he that hath taſted and
reliſhed ſuch grace in his <pb n="343" facs="tcp:61860:177"/>ſoule, will no more
deſire the meats and banquets of ſacrifices. And the Author ſpeaking of
grace doth very fitly and properly uſe the phraſe of eſtabliſhing the
heart. For our hearts, that is, our ſouls which are commonly ſignified by
the name of the heart, are eſtabliſhed and recreated not properly with
meats, which reach not to them, but with the grace of God, and is made active
and lively to performe all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties. <hi>Which have not profited
them that have been occupied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>] Here he brings the reaſon, why
in a manner he denied, that the heart is eſtabliſhed with meats, or that
ſuch eſtabliſhing is not ſo good a thing; namely, becauſe they that
have exerciſed therein, have found no profit thereby. To be occupied in meats
or (as the Greek hath it) to walke in meats, ſeeing here (as we have
ſhewed) meats ſignifie the meats of the ſacrifices or of the holy things,
is nothing elſe, but to partake of thoſe carnall ſacrifices, and to
accuſtome the eating of things offered and conſecrated, and placing therein
a part of Gods worſhip and ſerice. By thoſe who are ſaid to be occupied
in thoſe meats, are meant the Jewes, before they were illuminated in the
doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>Which have not profited them.</hi> The Jews found no
true profit by eating thoſe meats. For as Chriſt ſaith of Manna, John
6.49. <hi>Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe and are dead:</hi>
So may it well be ſaid, of the meats of the ſacrifices and things
conſecrated to God. Your fathers did eat the meats of ſacrifices and are
dead. But he that recreates and fills his ſoule with that grace of God which
is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and exhibited to men in the Goſpell, hee ſhall live for ever.
Therefore the words <hi>not profited</hi> doe not ſimply exclude all profit
and advantage wholly; for the meats of the ſacrifices did profit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in reſpect of that time, to repaire the ſtrength of the body for a ſhort
time; but they had not a true profit belonging to the Spirit, but only a
carnall profit, that was tranſitory and fugitive, not durable and eternall.
In which ſenſe alſo Chriſt ſaith of his fleſh eaten in a carnall
way, as his Diſciples underſtood it, Joh. 6 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that
quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing;</hi> that is, it furthereth nothing
unto life, to produce in men a ſpirituall and eternall life. It is the Spirit
that vivifies men, which, as from the ſpirituall eating of the fleſh of
Chriſt ſlaine for the life of the world, and from the ſpirituall drinking
of his bloud, ſo from that ſweet taſte of that divine grace, which was
confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the death and bloud of Chriſt, doth diſtill into our ſoules
and ſo revives and quickens us. From theſe words of the Author it is
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that to Chriſtian Religion it is nothing pertinent or profiting
to eat any true meat properly, and conſequently not the fleſh and bloud of
Chriſt. For if the body of Chriſt were properly eaten, and therein
conſiſted a part of Religion; would not the Author have oppoſed the meat
of Chriſts fleſh and bloud to the meats of thoſe ſacrifices? would he
have ſaid, we have an altar, whereof it is not lawfull for them to eat, 
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61860:178"/>no not for the Prieſts, if it be lawfull for the
Prieſts to eat the body and drinke the bloud of Chriſt offered every day
upon the altar, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull not to eat and drinke it? Would he have left us
only the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe and good workes, for the ſacrifices and
offerings of all animals and other creatures, which might be turned into
meats?</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>We have an altar whereof they have no right to
eat, which ſerve the Tabernacle</hi>] Hitherto the Author hath ſhewed that
there is very little or no cauſe, why Chriſtians ſhould deſire thoſe
ſacrifices of the Law and the meats of thoſe offerings; or ſhould place
ſome part of Gods worſhip or ſervice in them, or ſhould take it
grievouſly, that for the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion they are
drawne from commerce and communion with the Jewes and their ſtate. Now he
ſhews further, that it is not lawfull for Chriſtians to eat the meats of
ſacrifices, as was anciently done under the Law. He therefore ſaith, <hi>We
have an altar.</hi>] Any man may eaſily perceive that theſe words are
figurative and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, taken from the ordinances in the diſcipline of
Moſes, which for the moſt part cannot be applied to the diſcipline of
Chriſt, but by way of abuſion and impropriety; whereof we had no few
examples former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eſpecially in the compariſon of Chriſt with the
Leviticall Prieſts. For, for compariſons ſake, we many times uſe ſuch
words of a thing, which without reſpect to the compariſon wee would never
uſe. The ſame impropriety falls out againe here. In the Chriſtian
Religion, to ſpeake properly, there is no Altar, no Tabernacle to ſerve, no
Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which can be eaten; neither if we reſpect the eating of
ſacrifices or the abſtinence from them, is there any ſuch difference
betweene Chriſtians, as if ſome were Prieſts and Miniſters of the
Tabernacle, and others were not. Therefore in ſuch ſayings we muſt not
weigh every word ſingly by it ſelfe, as what is ſignified by the Altar,
what by the Tabernacle, and whereto it anſwers, but we muſt enquire for the
ſenſe of the whole ſentence: Wherefore theſe words import nothing
elſe, but that Chriſtians have no other ſacrifices, but ſuch whereof
they have no power to eat. By thoſe which ſerve the Tabernacle (which under
the Law were only Prieſts and Levites) are ſignified all Chriſtians in
generall. Chriſtians therefore are ſaid to be in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as if
under the Law there had been ſuch an Altar, whereof and of the ſacrifices
laid upon it, and offered unto God, it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man to eat, no
not for the Prieſts themſelves and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the houſe of
God, much leſſe for the reſt of the people. For if there had been ſuch
an Altar under the Law, then it is apparent unto all men, that the eating of
ſacrifices and things offered unto God, ſhould have had no place under the
Law. But thus it is under the Goſpell; and therefore the eating of
ſacrifices muſt be to Chriſtians unlawfull.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>For the bodies of thoſe beaſts whoſe bloud
is brought into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie <pb n="345" facs="tcp:61860:178"/>by the high Prieſt for
ſinne, are burnt without the campe</hi>] Here the Author proves by his
aſſertion in the former verſe, why in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the matter is ſo
ordered, that under the Goſpel there is ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, whereof the
Sacrifices are not permitted to be eaten of any man. Yet he propoſeth his
argument ſo conciſely and briefly that he ſeemes rather to point at it,
then explicate it. And it manifeſtly appeares that the Authour takes it as
graunted for a ground, That Chriſtians have no other Sacrifice, but what is
reſembled by the entrance of the high Prieſt into the Sanctuary, or by
thoſe beaſts onely, whoſe bloud was brought into the Sanctuary by the
high Prieſt, and their bodies were burnt without the campe. For unleſſe
the Author took this for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he could not from this (that in thoſe
ſacrifices it was not lawful to eat the fleſh of the offering) ſimply
conclude, that it is not lawfull for us Chriſtians to eat ſacrifices, or
that we have an altar whereof we may not lawfully eat. And this he might well
take for granted, because by that Sacrifice whereby our high Prieſt entred
into his Sanctuary under the new Covenant, all things were perfomed, whether we
reſpect the plenary expiation of our ſinnes, or the full reconciliation of
Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace towards us, that for that effect there is no further
need of any Sacrifices of beaſts or other things corporeall. Neither is there
reaſon, why any man ſhould ſay, that in the Chriſtian Religion there
are other Sacrifices and oblations, which Chriſtians muſt offer; and
therefore by that ſacrifice other Sacrifices and oblations are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For the Author doth not oppoſe that Sacrifice to thoſe that are wholly
incorporeall and ſpirituall, and whereof no meat can be made, as are the
Sacrifices to be offered by Chriſtians, such as a contrite and humbled heart,
as David ſpeakes, the Sacrifices of praiſe, the fruits of our lippes,
confeſſing unto the name of God, communicating or doing good (as the
Authour hath it afterwards) and other workes of pietie. But hee oppoſeth it
to thoſe Sacrifices, wherein are offered things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall and fit for food;
ſo that he leaves no further place for all theſe. Therefore herewith the
Sacrifice of the Maſſe muſt needs fall, wherein a thing corporeall that
may be eaten, is ſaid to be daily offered. But ſome man may demand, how it
can be true, that in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there remaines that Sacrifice,
whereby the bloud of ſlaine beaſts was by the Prieſts brought into the
Sanctuary for ſinne, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies burnt without the campe. We anſwer,
because that under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity there remaines the Sacrifice of Chriſt our
high Prieſt, which is the antitype and ſolid body, whereof that Sacrifice
was but a type and ſhadow. Which ſacrifice of Chriſt by the comming of
it, hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all other carnall ſacrifices, and the eating of them.
Whereof this is an open and manifeſt argument, that in the type and ſhadow
of it, there was no place allowed for eating, but the bodies of the beaſts
ſlaine for it, were wholly burnt, and that without the campe. Yet it is 
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61860:179"/>not neceſſary, we ſhould ſay, that here is a
reference, to that yearly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice onely, whereby the high Prieſt entered
the Oracle, or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all; ſeeing the reference may be to all
thoſe Sacrifices, which were made as well for the high Prieſt himſelf, as
for the whole people. For the bloud of thoſe beaſts that were ſlaine for
a ſin-offering, was by the high Prieſt brought into the Sanctuary, although
not into the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or holieſt place of all, yet into the firſt Tabernacle
which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the Sanctuary, chap. 9. verſ. 2. (which in other
Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for private men was not done, wherein the bloud of the beaſts
ſlain, after the high Prieſt had ſprinkled the hornes of the Altar that
ſtood in the court at the doore of the Tabernacle, was all poured downe at
the bottome of the Altar, Levit. 4.25) and the bodies of the beaſts ſo
ſlaine for ſinne-offerings, were no leſſe burned without the campe,
then was done in that ſolemne anniverſary Sacrifice, as it appears in the
ſame fourth chapter of Leviticus.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Wherefore Ieſus alſo, that he might
ſanctifie the people with his own bloud, ſuffered without the gate.</hi>]
Becauſe hee had ſaid, that in thoſe Sacrifices, that caryed a type and
ſhadow of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, the bodies of the beaſts ſlaine were
wholly burnt without the campe; therefore he affirmes it came to paſſe,
that Jeſus alſo whom thoſe beaſts ſlaine for the Expiation and
Salvation of the whole people, fully repreſented and ſhadowed, ſuffered
without the gate. And this hee doth for this end, that the conformitie and
reſemblance betweene the tipe and antitipe, betweene the ſhadow and the
bodie might appeare the better, which at the firſt ſight would
ſufficiently argue, that one was referred to the other. The Citie of
Jeruſalem, wherein the people after their conquest of Canaan, ſeated
themſelves, is anſwerable to the campe wherewith they journeyed in the
wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſucceeded in the roome of that campe. And therefore in
this reſpect, it was all one for a man to bee drawne without the gate or
walles of Jeruſalem, when the people dwelt in that Citie, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the
campe, when they had a campe for their Citie. <hi>Ieſus alſo</hi>] the
particle <hi>alſo</hi> hath in this place the force of a compariſon; as if
hee had ſaid, not onely the bodies of thoſe beaſts were burnt without the
campe: but Jeſus alſo himſelfe ſuffered without the gate.
<hi>Suffered,</hi>] namely, the death of the Croſſe, the <hi>genus</hi>
being put for the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> And the death of Chriſt is
anſwerable, not onely to the ſlaughter of the beaſts that were made
within the campe and Citie, or compaſſe of the Temple, but alſo to the
burning of their bodies, which was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without the campe and City; for
this death anſwered their ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as his bloud was ſhed, and their
burning, as his body was buried. And the things that in the tipe and ſhadow
were as it were ſevered, were in the antitipe and body united, ſo that
onely death in Chriſt, anſwered both the ſlaughter and burning of the
beaſts. <hi>That hee might <pb n="347" facs="tcp:61860:179"/>ſanctifie the people.</hi>
In theſe words Chriſt is tacitely compared with the legall high Prieſt,
whoſe proper office it was to ſanctifie or expiate, not this or that
ſingle perſon, but the whole people, and the bloud of Chriſt is compared
to the bloud of thoſe beaſts, which was ſhed for the whole people. And
Jeſus did ſanctifie and wholly expiate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with his bloud, in that
by the intervention of his cruell death hee entered into the heavenly
Sanctuary, and appeares for us for ever in the ſight of God, to make
interceſſion for us: <hi>i.</hi> to free us by his care from all the guilt
and penalties of our ſinnes. For the ſame ſaying is expreſſed by
Saint Paul in other words, Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the
curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> For that which is
ſanctified or made holy, is rightly oppoſed to that which is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated or
made a curſe. Wee have already obſerved heretofore, that the Author thought
he had occaſion to ſpeak of Chriſts bloud brought into the heavenly
Tabernacle, whereto his compariſon and reſemblance of Chriſt to the
legall high Prieſt might invite him; yet doth purpoſely avoide it, and
uſeth onely words, from which it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that our ſinnes were
expiated by the bloud of Chriſt, yet not as brought into the Tabernacle of
heaven and offered unto God, but onely as it was ſhed, and prepared entrance
for Chriſt into heaven, and there to help himſelfe unto God. The ſame
caution is uſed alſo by the Author in this place, who in the former verſe
having made expreſſe mention of the bloud of beaſts, brought by the high
Prieſt into the Sanctuarie for ſin-offerings; yet when hee comes to the
bloud of Chriſt, ſaith nothing else of it, but that hee Sanctified his
people with it, or as it is in the Greeke <hi>by it,</hi> that is, by
ſhedding it. <hi>By his owne bloud.</hi>] Not as the high Prieſt under the
Law, who ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the people by bloud, yet not by his owne bloud, but by
the bloud of beaſts: but becauſe Chriſt was to ſanctifie the people by
his owne bloud, therefore hee muſt ſuffer without the gate, and bee
ſlaughtered by an infamous death, to fit him for the ſubſequent offering
of himſelfe afterward to God in the heavenly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <hi>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the
campe</hi>] After the Author had ſhewed that the Hebrewes conſidering they
have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Chriſtian Religion, muſt not eate or banquet with the
meates of ſacrifices, as if ſome part of divine worship or ſervice were
therein contained; now from the infamous death which Chriſt ſuffered
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gate, he inferres, that they muſt not regard it at all, if for
Chriſts ſake they be driven from the reſt of the Jews, not onely from
their temples, ſacrifices, and holy banquets, but even from their City, from
their commerce and civill ſociety; yea although they be publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached
as impious and curſed perſons, and cut off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Jews
common-wealth; or at laſt loſe their lives by the ſame 
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61860:180"/>or the like puniſhment, under which Chriſt their head
and Captaine ſuffered. And this he therefore inferres, becauſe the hatred
of the Jews againſt the Chriſtians contained not it ſelfe, with
prohibiting them from their Ceremonies, ſacrifices and temple: but proceeded
ſo farre as to drive them from their common-wealth and Civill commerce, with
publique infamy and reproach, onely becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Religion
and name of Chriſt. <hi>Let us goe therefore</hi>] Seeing our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, our high Prieſt and heavenly King, was led out without the gate,
and ſo ſeparated from the reſt of the corporation of men, and there put
to an infamous death, therefore <hi>Let us goe forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him without the
camp.</hi> Let us willingly and freely, with an open and ready heart undergoe
together with him, baniſhment, reproaches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, death and all manner of
evils. Chriſt now lives without the camp, without the City, without the gate;
ſhall we not willingly goe forth, to be rather with him alone, then among the
wicked multitude of the Jews? For we are happier without the camp with
Chriſt, then in the camp without Chriſt; ſeeing where Chriſt is, there
is true happineſſe. Why the Author names the campe, we ſhewed the cauſe
before, ver. 12. <hi>Bearing his reproach</hi>] To beare the reproach of
Chriſt, is to refuſe no ſuffering for Chriſts ſake, that Chriſt
himſelfe did beare. For in the word <hi>reproach</hi> are included all evils
that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon a man; becauſe evils are alwayes inflicted with
infamy and reproach. And the reproach of Chriſt, is any reproach like to his
reproach, and for the like cauſe that he bare his? namely for the
teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that truth which he publiſhed; that we may ſubconfirme by
our death what he preconfirmed by his. For it is not the ſuffering but the
cauſe that makes the martyr.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>For here have we no continuing City</hi>] He
annexeth a new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why we ſhould goe forth without our camps, that is,
beare it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to be ejected and exiled out of our Country or City;
becauſe here upon earth we have no continuing city, <hi>i.</hi> none that is
durable, which cannot be taken from us, nor we from it. All the cities which we
inhabit upon earth, we inhabit onely for a time. Why therefore ſhould we
refuſe for Chriſts ſake to loſe that city, which otherwiſe we muſt
wholly loſe in a very ſhort ſpace? Or elſe the Author teacheth us, that
we Chriſtians as we are Chriſtians, enjoy no City upon earth by any firme
and proper poſſeſſion: but in this reſpect we are alwayes ſubject
to expulſions, baniſhments and ſuch like miſeries. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
therefore might with good reaſon uſe this admonition, to teach Chriſtians
what is their ſtate and condition upon earth, eſpecially the Hebrewes who
might imagine, becauſe they proceeded from the ſtock of Abraham, therefore
they had full right to enjoy the freedome of the city Jeruſalem no leſſe
then others of their Nation, and thereupon muſt needs take it grievouſly to
be excluded from their inheritance. <pb n="349" facs="tcp:61860:180"/>Therefore he ſhews
that Chriſtians have another inheritance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a right to another city
farre more excellent. <hi>But wee ſeeke one to come</hi>] This is that
permanent and continuing city, from the poſſeſſion whereof wee ſhall
never be diſturbed in any age; for to this city wee have a right by Chriſt,
who is the head and king of it, that there wee may live ſafely under him and
reigne under him. But as long as wee live here on earth, we are like pilgrims
and ſtrangers; who are travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling toward their countrey. He calls this city
<hi>to come,</hi> becauſe to us it is to come; but to God, and Chriſt, and
the Angels it is already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The word <hi>we ſeeke</hi> although it
ſignifie the effect it ſelfe, yet it muſt not here be taken ſo much for
the effect, as for the efficacy of Chriſtian Religion, and our duty therein.
For then wee ſeeke when we follow the power and guidance of Chriſtian
Religion: Becauſe it is the condition and duty of Chriſtians to ſeeke a
City to come, that is, to endeavour with all care and diligence that they may
attaine it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of
praiſe</hi>] Here he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to a new precept or duty, yet ſuch a one as
iſſues from his former words and depends on them; as the illative particle
<hi>therefore</hi> ſhewes. Yet it followes not from the words immediately
preceding, but both from his principall aſſertion, and from what was
included in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. The principall aſſertion is, That the
doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is immutable; as it was in the beginning, ſo
ſhall it remaine for all ages. In the argument or proofe of this doctrine,
Chriſt in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the high Prieſt is ſaid to ſanctifie the
people with his bloud. Now from this, that the doctrine of Chriſt is alwayes
ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme as to be one and the ſame, ſubject to no alteration; and
that Chriſt is our high Prieſt, who hath ſanctified his whole people with
his bloud, it is rationally inferred, that we muſt by him offer ſacrifices
to God. For anciently the whole people joyntly, and ſingle perſons from
among the people offered ſacrifices to God by the Prieſt; the whole people
by the high Prieſt onely, but private perſons by Prieſts of an inferiour
order; all which, together with the high Prieſt, as others were to offer
ſacrifices by them, are correſpondent to Chriſt alone; for in this
reſpect Chriſt alone is as much as all they together. For, although in the
Chriſtian Religion beſides Chriſt our high Prieſt there are other
Prieſts, namely all Chriſtians, yet compared to Chriſt they muſt be
accounted for the common people. And to offer ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Chriſt, is to
offer ſuch ſacrifices as are conſecrated and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it were by
Chriſt himſelfe, and by him are made acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; and this is done
when we offer them as the worſhippers and ſervitors of Chriſt, by faith
in God, in and through Chriſt, by the preſcript and command of Chriſt;
for what is offered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is offered as it were by the hand of
CHRIST himſelfe. <hi>The Sacrifice of Praiſe.</hi> Here hee ſpecifies
what kinde of Sacrifices <pb n="350" facs="tcp:61860:181"/>Chriſtians are to offer unto
God, namely, the Sacrifices of Praiſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all carnall Sacrifices
uſed under the law are abrogated, and the ſpirituall Sacrifice of Praiſe,
is ſucceeded in the roome of all thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which were peculiarly
offered of every one under the Law. The ſacrifice of praiſe by a genetive
of the ſpecies, is the praiſe it ſelfe and celebration of Gods name, or
the act of thankſgiving unto him. And although our prayers which we powre
forth unto God, be ſcarce at any time, at leaſt eſpecially and
principally called ſacrifices, but are rather compared with incenſe,
becauſe they are to bee uttered and aſcend unto God from an ardent
ſpirit; yet there is nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but that we may include our
prayers alſo in theſe ſacrifices of praiſe; ſeeing they are uſually
joyned with our praiſes and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings unto God: And this very act of
imploring Gods helpe in all things, containes no ſmall part of celebrating
and praiſing Gods name. <hi>Continually</hi>] This ſacrifice of praiſe
muſt be offered, continually and daily without ceaſing any day; ſo that
no part or day of our life muſt be vacant or void of this ſacrifice. For
theſe ſpirituall ſacrifices are of that nature, that they may be offered
continually day after day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing any day; for ſeeing God
multiplies his bleſſings continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon us, and gives us every day our
daily bread, therefore we muſt continually offer ſacrifice unto him, giving
him daily praiſe and thankſgiving. <hi>To God</hi>] God is the ſame, to
whom theſe ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices muſt be offered by Chriſt; for he
is the ſame perſon that was worſhipped and ſerved under the old
Covenant, and muſt be ſo againe under the new, only the manner and way of
his worſhip and ſervice is changed under the new. <hi>That is, the fruit of
our lips</hi>] Hee yet further ſpecifies and explicates the ſacrifice of
praiſe, that it is the fruit not of our corne or our cattell, as it was
anciently under the Law, but of our lippes; the fruit that grows on our lips as
on the branches, whoſe roots are the inmoſt receſſes of the heart, as
we ſee it in the fruits of trees, which grow indeed and hang upon the
branches, but draw their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and their ſap from the loweſt roots of
the trees. <hi>Giving thanks to his name.</hi>] He yet declares more
ſpecially what this fruit of our lips is, and ſaith it is our
thankſgiving to the name of God. The word in the Greeke, is
<hi>confeſsing</hi> to his name. But it is well knowne, that the Hebrew
phraſe of confeſſing to God, doth ſignifie to celebrate, praiſe, and
give thanks unto God. For confeſſing to God is a generall word,
comprehending all manner of our ſpeech unto God, whether we ſpeak of his
attributes, perfections or workes in generall, which is Praiſe; or of his
particular bleſſings and benefits to us, which is Thankſgiving; or of our
ſinfulneſſe and offences againſt him, which we ſimply call
Confeſſion.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>But to doe good and to communicate forget
not</hi>] Here he proceeds to another precept or duty of Chriſtians; namely,
to beneficence or <pb n="351" facs="tcp:61860:181"/>communicating toward the poore and
needy, which he reckons among ſpirituall ſacrifices, that he might allude
to the cuſtome obſerved under the Law. For in the ſacrifices of the peace
offerings, whereto our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſacrifices are moſt reſembling, they
were wont to make feaſts, to which they commonly invited the poor, and
eſpecially the Levites that miniſtred in the Temple, that by this means
they might exerciſe their beneficence toward the meaner ſort. This vertue
the Author would not have to ceaſe under the Goſpell, although under it the
ſacrifices of beaſts, and ſuch other carnall things are ceaſed. <hi>We
communicate</hi>] When as often as need requires, we impart unto others, that
part of our means which was properly our owne; and make that as it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to many, which was before proper to our ſelves. <hi>Forget not</hi>] Although
the offerings of carnall ſacrifices be ceaſed, and thereby the occaſion
of doing good and communicating may ſeeme to be cut off: yet ye muſt ſo
offer your ſpirituall ſacrifices, that ye may bee alwayes mindfull and
carefull of doing good, whereof fit and opportune occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will never be
wanting. <hi>For with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed</hi>] Here is
the reaſon given, why we muſt doe good and communicate, becauſe this
beneficence to the poore is a ſacrifice, and ſuch a ſacrifice as
wherewith God is well pleaſed. For the words, <hi>ſuch ſacrifices,</hi>
muſt be referred both to the ſacrifice of praiſe, and to the ſacrifice
of beneficence. For even under the Law both theſe ſacrifices were more
pleaſing unto God then the ſacrifices of ſheep and oxen. For ſaith God,
<hi>Will I eat the fleſh of bulls or drinke the bloud of goats? Offer unto
God thankſgiving and pay thy vows unto the moſt High,</hi> Pſal.
50.13,14. And againe, <hi>For I deſired mercy, and not ſacrifice; and the
knowledge of God more then burnt offerings,</hi> Hoſ. 6.6. God would rather
have the things which were anciently offered unto him, to be ſpent upon man
who needs them, then upon himſelfe who needs them not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath
releaſed his whole right thereto, that they might wholly be transferred upon
needy men. Hence it manifeſtly appeares, that the community of goods is not
commanded under the Goſpell; for if all goods were common, how could we doe
good and communicate, ſeeing that which is already common cannot be
communicated? And how ſhould we performe that ſervice of God, which
conſiſteth in the ſacrifice of doing good and communicating, wherewith
God is well pleaſed?</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you.</hi>] Here
is the laſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall precept or dutie that he gives unto Chriſtians. By
them that rule, hee meanes the Rectors, Elders, and Biſhops of the Church,
who are called Rulers, becauſe they rule and governe the Church, by doctrine,
exhortation, and example of life, by Counſels, Admonitions, and
Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cenſures. Theſe Rulers we muſt obey, though the
things they require of us, be many times harſh and troubleſom to us. Yet
this <pb n="352" facs="tcp:61860:182"/>precept of obedience muſt be extended no further,
then to ſuch things as are conformable to the Lawes of God, in reference
whereto the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Church are to frame all their Rules and Commands.
<hi>And ſubject your ſelves.</hi>] This is but an explication or
deſignation of that obedience, which in the former words hee required of us
toward our rulers; becauſe obedience is nothing elſe but a ſubjection of
our ſelves to them that have the rule over us. <hi>For they watch for your
ſoules.</hi>] He brings a reaſon for this precept of our obedience, drawne
from the office of our Rulers; becauſe it is their office and dutie to be
very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and carefull for their ſoules, who are committed to their
charge. For they that keep watch have a diligent care of them, for whom they
watch, that no danger may befall them. And common watchmen watch for our
bodies, but the Rulers of the Church watch for our ſoules, that no mans
ſoule ſhould periſh, or that no man ſhould faile of that true and
eternall ſalvation of ſoules. Whence it appeares what great reaſon wee
have to obey our Rulers, whoſe charge and care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs wholly to our
ſoules, and whoſe commands and admonitions we can deſpiſe, with no
leſſe danger then the loſſe of our ſoules. <hi>As they that muſt
give account.</hi>] Now on the other ſide he ſhewes a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the duty
of our Rulers whom God hath appointed over us, why they muſt uſe all
diligent care to watch for our ſoules; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt give an
account of their office and actions to God and Chriſt, who hath committed his
poore ſheep to their care and charge; ſo that if any periſh through their
default or negligence, they muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it under a grievous penaltie.
For to this purpoſe tend thoſe words of God in Ezekiel. <hi>So thou, O
ſonne of man, I have ſet thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael;
therefore thou ſhalt heare the word at my mouth, and warne them from me. When
I ſay unto the wicked, O wicked man! thou ſhalt ſurely die; If thou
doſt not ſpeake to warne the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall
die in his iniquitie; but his bloud will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at thine hand.
Nevertheleſſe, if thou warne the wicked of his way to turne from it: if he
doe not turne from his way, he ſhall die in his iniquitie: but thou haſt
delivered thy ſoule,</hi> Ezek. 33.7,8,9. Therefore this ſo weightie and
ſo dangerous an Office, which our Rulers bear, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together require on
their part, that they bee carefull to watch for our ſoules; and it well
deſerves on our part, that we ſhould obey and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſelves unto
them, and not take it in ill part, if, to provide not onely for our
ſalvation, but their owne, they refuſe to humour and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our fancies.
<hi>That they may doe it with joy, and not with griefe</hi>] Hee yet
preſſeth our obedience with a further reaſon; namely, that our Rulers may
reape ſome ſpirituall fruit of their Office, and performe it with joy, and
not with griefe. For certainely this their Office ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to
themſelves, and ſo commodious to us, doth deſerve this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at our
hands, that in the function of their Office, wee ſhould ſo 
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61860:182"/>carry our ſelves, as to be a comfort and joy unto them,
and not a griefe. And we are a joy unto them, when we ſhew our ſelves
obſequious and pliant to their doctrines, precepts, and warnings: but we are
a griefe to them when we are refractory and obſtinate. <hi>And not with
griefe</hi>] In the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
which properly and adequatly ſignifies ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which is the outward
effect and ſigne of inward griefe, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For to this effect are the
words of Saint Paul 2. Cor. 2.3. <hi>And I wrote this ſame unto you, leſt
when I came, I ſhould have ſorrow from them of whom I ought to
rejoyce.</hi> And again in the ſame Epiſtle, chap. 12.21. <hi>I feare
leſt when I come again, my God will humble me among you &amp; that I ſhall
bewail many, which have ſinned already, and have not repented. For that is
unprofitable for you</hi>] This is ſpoken by way of mollifying or
diminiſhing the matter. For to grieve our rulers by our diſobedience, is
not only unprofitable to us, but very hurtfull. Seeing God wil take ſore
vengeance upon us for this double offence, that we ſhould deſerve ſo ill
at Rulers hands, who watch ſo piouſly &amp; carefully for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our ſouls, as to repay their diligence &amp; care with grief &amp;
ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Pray for us.</hi>] A particular precept or
requeſt unto the Hebrews: But he ſpeaks onely of himſelfe in the plurall
number, as it appeares in the verſe following, wherein expreſſing what
they ſhould pray for, he mentions a thing concerning himſelfe onely.
<hi>For wee truſt wee have a good conſcience</hi>] Hee ſubjoynes the
ground or cauſe of his requeſt; namely, becauſe hee was not a perſon
altogether unworthy to obtain this good Office from them. But hee ſpeakes
very modeſtly and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of himſelfe, that he might decline all envie.
For firſt, hee ſaith not ſimply, we have a good conſcience; but we
truſt wee have a good conſcience; ſo wee beleeve, and ſo wee perſwade
our ſelves; which could not but bee improperly ſpoken, ſeeing to ſpeake
properly, a good conſcience conſiſteth in the perſwaſion of it
ſelfe. Therefore a good conſcience is in this place taken for the cauſe
of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is, for a life unblameable or voide of all
offence; as if he had ſaid, I truſt and am perſwaded, that I ſo live
and ſo carry my ſelfe, that my conſcience may well be at reſt with my
actions. Secondly, hee ſpeakes in the plurall number, and by way of
communication doth mingle himſelfe in a manner with the multitude, ſeeming
alſo to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no more of himſelfe then of them. <hi>In all things
willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</hi>] Hee ſhewes the reaſon of his confidence,
why he truſteth that he hath a good conſcience; namely, becauſe hee is
willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in all things. Hee ſaith not, that actually hee
doth live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in all things, but affectively hee is willing to live
ſo; which is much more modeſt. But his willingneſſe herein muſt not
be taken for the ſole purpoſe and intention of his minde: but of his
ſtudy, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and labour; or of a will continually actuall and
effectuall. For ſo Saint Paul teſtifies of himſelfe. Acts 24.16. <hi>And
herein doe I exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <pb n="354" facs="tcp:61860:183"/>my ſelf, to have alwayes a
good conſcience, void of offence toward God and toward men.</hi> And this is
to live well and honeſtly in all things, namely, in all our actions and
dealings; when thou carrieſt thy ſelfe ſo uprightly, that thou
deſerveſt no juſt reproofe or blame, neither in the ſight of God nor of
men: <hi>Before God,</hi> in being cleare from all ſpot, from which a
Chriſtian life ought to be free: and <hi>before men,</hi> in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
ſuch a one, that thou giveſt no juſt occaſion to any, either to thinke
or ſuſpect evill of thee; and doſt ſhun all ſuch things, as though
they be not determined by any Law of God, yet are diſhoneſt in mens
opinion.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>But I beſeech you the rather to doe this</hi>]
Namely, to pray for me. And the adverbe <hi>the rather,</hi> may be referred to
the next verbe before it, I beſeech you; as if he had ſaid, I beſeech you
ſo much the rather to pray for me, that I may be reſtored unto you the
ſooner; or it may bee referred to the verbe after it <hi>to doe this;</hi> as
if he had ſaid, I beſeech you, that you would the rather pray for me. But
for what? <hi>That I may bee reſtored unto you the ſooner.</hi>] He ſhews
the end and fruit of their prayers to what effect they ſhould the rather, and
the more earneſtly pray for him; namely, thereby to obtaine from God, that he
might be reſtored unto them the ſooner; that is, that his returne unto them
might be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, then it was like to be as things now ſtood. For it
ſeems hee was already free from priſon, and ſet at liberly, as may bee
gathered from the 23. verſe following.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Now the God of peace</hi>] Here begins the
cloſe of this Epiſtle, which firſt containes a devotion concluded with a
doxologie; then certaine monitions, or rather requeſts, which againe he ends
with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther devotion, and withall ends the whole Epiſtle. In his devotion,
he firſt names and deſcribes the perſon, of whom all thoſe things are
to be performed, which he prayeth and wiſheth to them: Then are
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the wiſhes themſelves. He ſaith therefore, <hi>But the God
of peace</hi>] The particle <hi>but</hi> containes a tacit oppoſition; as if
he had ſaid, I have hitherto propoſed unto you divers monitions and
precepts; but the God of peace enable you to keep them. But he deſcribes the
Author and donor of the bleſſings he wiſheth unto them, firſt in
calling him <hi>the God of peace.</hi> And the deſcriptions of God, that
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed in wiſhes, are commonly
fitted to the wiſhes themſelves. In this place, becauſe the Author
wiſheth to the Hebrewes that which might render them truly happy, namely that
in all reſpects they might pleaſe God; therefore by the word <hi>peace</hi>
ſeems to be meant rather happineſſe according to the ordinary phraſe
among the Hebrewes, then concord, or what elſe the word peace doth
elſewhere ſignifie; and in this ſenſe this title is more frequently
attributed unto God, but in the other ſeldome. And God is called the God of
peace, that is, of happineſſe, not only becauſe God alone can make men
happy, but becauſe hee will and alſo doth <pb n="355" facs="tcp:61860:183"/>make them
ſo, by ſupplying them abundantly with all thoſe meanes and helpes whereby
true happineſſe may be attained by men. And therefore in this place hee
deſcribes God in this manner, thereby to teach us, that from him proceeds all
happineſſe, and from him muſt bee ſought, and may be eaſily obtained
all things belonging to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, becauſe he is ready and free to
grant happineſſe to all that ſeeke it by due means. <hi>That brought
againe from the dead our Lord Ieſus that great ſhepheard of the ſheep
through the bloud of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>] He adjoynes another
deſcription of God; from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how certainly God will make
thoſe men happy and bleſſed, that believe and obey him. And hee mentions
that mighty and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable worke of God, which to all the godly brings a moſt
aſſured hope of eternall happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe; and ſo
he manifeſtly proves him to be the God of peace or happineſſe. And this
worke was, That he brought againe from the dead our Lord Jeſus that great
Shepheard of the ſheep, and that through the bloud of the everlaſting
Covenant: wherein hee deſcribes withall our Lord Jeſus himſelfe; that
hence it may appeare, what an infinit bleſſing God beſtowed upon men, by
this bringing againe of our Lord Jeſus from the dead. If God had delivered
but ſome ordinary man from the dead and eſtated him in eternall life, yet
even for that he muſt needs bee accounted the author of happineſſe. But
now, that he hath raiſed from the dead not an ordinary perſon, but the
Shepheard of the ſheep, not an ordinary ſhepheard, but that great
Shepheard; nor conſtituted by an ordinary way, but through the bloud of the
everlaſting Covenant; he is much more to be accounted the author and donor of
happineſſe: Which that this Author might declare the more amply and fully,
therefore it is, that he proceeds by words that are very paſſionate and
ſtately. <hi>That brought againe from the dead</hi>] That raiſed from death
to life. The word <hi>reducing</hi> or <hi>bringing againe</hi> is very
accommodate to ſignifie that God was the Shepheard of Chriſt our Shepheard,
whoſe office it is to lead forth his ſheep and <hi>bring them againe;</hi>
and that God brought Chriſt againe from the hideous den of death, and ſo
together with him all his ſheep. For the reduction of our Shepheard from the
grave, is alſo our reduction and reſurrection from it. It was in our
Shepheard firſt that God ſhewed an eſſay of his great power and
goodneſſe; and that experiment on Chriſt was an engagement unto us, to
aſſure us alſo of our reſurrection. But who this God of peace is that
brought againe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, both the thing it
ſelf and the holy Scriptures clearly ſhew, namely that it is the Father of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In the deſcription of our Lord Jeſus almoſt
every word of the Author is emphaticall. For firſt hee calls him the
Shepheard of the ſheep, which muſt not be underſtood as reſtrained to
that time only wherein Chriſt lived upon earth, but enlarged (and much
rather) to <pb n="356" facs="tcp:61860:184"/>the time following, ſince he ſat on the
Throne of God; for ſince that time, he became moſt perfectly &amp; properly
the Shepheard of the ſheep. Now Chriſt is the Shepheard of the ſheep, not
only becauſe he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to them the wholeſome food of Gods word and
Spirit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he every way lookes unto them; for he aſſembles and
collects them, he governes and defends them, and finally procures their
eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation. For it is the part of a Shepheard, not only to feed the
ſheep, but to defend and governe them, and looke to them in all things as
need ſhall require. Whence Peter when he called our Saviour the Shepheard,
addeth to it the word Biſhop, which ſignifies a Guardian, eſpecially as
the Hebrewes uſe to underſtand it, 1 Pet. 2.25. For when wee have a great
care of any thing, we often viſit, inſpect, and ſee it; from whence
ariſeth the word Biſhop, which properly ſignifies a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or
overſeer. Hee that deſires to know the properties of a good ſhepheard,
let him read in the tenth Chapter of John the parable of the good Shepheard,
which there Chriſt applies unto himſelfe. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>that</hi>
prefixed here before the Shepheard teacheth us, that he is no ordinary or
vulgar ſhepheard, but an eminent and excellent perſon, whoſe
deſcription and promiſe alſo is extant, Ezek. 24. But the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
the word <hi>great</hi> unto this Shepheard declares his excellency more
manifeſtly, when the Author ſaith, <hi>that great Shepheard</hi>] For by
this appellation he ſpecifies, what manner of ſhepheard he underſtands,
namely a Shepheard ſo exceeding great that in compariſon of him all other
ſhepheards are very little. In which ſenſe alſo St. Peter calls him the
chiefe Shepheard, or Prince of ſhepheards, 1 Pet. 5.4. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Chriſt muſt needs be a great Shepheard indeed, ſeeing hee is equall to
God in wiſdome, power and dominion, ſeated in heaven at the right hand of
God, upon the throne of God, and feeds his ſheepe wholly in the ſame manner
that God doth; ſeeing he appoints all other ſhepheards of his ſheep, and
hath them ſubject unto him, ſeeing he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his ſheep out of all
Nations into one ſheep-fold of his Church; ſeeing though he hath an
innumerable multitude of ſheep yet he knows them all, and ſo provides for
all that no one can ſtray from him, no one can periſh, no one can want his
care for feeding, ruling and defending; and laſtly, ſeeing he ſo feeds
his ſheep that he recovers them from the jaws of death and hell, and
ſettles them in poſſeſſion of the Kingdome of Heaven. <hi>Through the
bloud of the everlaſting Covenant</hi>] Theſe words muſt not be referred
to the words <hi>brought again,</hi> but muſt be conſtrued with the word
<hi>ſhepheard.</hi> And a ſhepheard <hi>by</hi> or <hi>through bloud,</hi>
is ſuch a ſhepheard as had ſhed his bloud; for ſo we read 1 John 5.6.
That Chriſt came by water and bloud, not by water only, but by water and
bloud; that is, he was not only pure and clear from all ſpot or ſtain of
ſinne, which purity is ſignified by the word water; but alſo that he
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a bloudy death by ſhedding of his bloud. The Author had
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated <pb n="357" facs="tcp:61860:184"/>before, that this great Shepheard was dead, in
ſaying, that God brought him againe from the dead: but now he further
ſhewes not onely the manner of his death, that it was violent, cruell and
bloudy; but alſo the cauſe of his death, to what end he dyed, which end
tendeth to our infinite benefit, namely to confirme and ſeale <hi>the
everlaſting covenant.</hi> For the bloud of the Covenant is that bloud which
is ſhed to dedicate, eſtabliſh and confirme the Covenant, that it may
never be revokeable. But the Author underſtands the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was
confirmed by the bloud of Chriſt. Whence wee may eaſily collect, how
certaine and ſure we may be of the promiſes contained in that Covenant, if
we performe the conditions of it, which are moſt juſt and equall. When he
calls this Covenant <hi>everlaſting,</hi> he tacitly oppoſeth it to the old
covenant by Moſes, which was not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the world, &amp;
therfore was not properly everlaſting. And by the eternity of this Covenant,
that it is everlaſting, is withall intimated the perfection of it; for if it
were not perfect, it could not be everlaſting; as the former old covenant was
not everlaſting, becauſe it was not perfect, but weake and unprofitable;
and therefore it was diſanulled and aboliſhed; as the Author ſaid before,
chap. 7.18. For there is verily a diſanulling of the commandement going
before, for the weakeneſſe and unprofitableneſſe thereof. And what is
ſaid of one commandement or precept, may well be referred to the whole
cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Beſides, the eternity of this covenant is mentioned of purpoſe
to advance our comfort and ſtrengthen our hope; for whereas it is called
everlaſting, that ſhews that it ſhall not onely produce his full effect,
but alſo ſhall laſt to the end of the world. <hi>Our Lord Ieſus</hi>]
In theſe words the Author points out the perſon, whom we muſt
underſtand to be that great Shepheard; namely, no other then our Lord
Jeſus, that is, our Lord who is Jeſus; ſo that our Lord, holds the place
of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the name Jeſus is added, to declare who is meant by
our Lord. By which appellation the Author teacheth us, what a great Shepheard
Jeſus is, ſeeing he is our Lord, conſtituted ſo by God his Father, who
brought him againe from the dead. That onely Lord, by whom are all things, and
we by him; whom wee muſt worſhip with God the Father. Yet in all this
pathetick and ſtately deſcription of our Lord Jeſus the Author
ſignifies nothing more unto us, then what was formerly contained in his
appellation of high Prieſt, ſo frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto him in this
Epiſtle. From all which, what great hope and comfort wee may gather to our
ſoules, need not here bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Make you perfect in every good worke</hi>] Now he
expreſſeth the wiſh it ſelfe, which is wholly concerning their owne
duty. For to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternall happineſſe nothing elſe is required on our
part but to performe our duty, according as it is enjoyned us. To make them 
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61860:185"/>
                  <hi>perfect</hi> in every good worke, is ſo to enable
them, that no good worke, office, or Chriſtian vertue be wanting in them; and
that they be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in no good worke, to performe it perfunctorily,
unwillingly or diſaffectedly; eſpecially in point of temptation, and matter
of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, wherein becauſe it is for the triall of their faith,
Patience muſt have her perfect worke, as S. James requires it, Jam. 1.4.
<hi>To doe his will</hi>] The particle <hi>to</hi> here doth not ſignifie the
finall cauſe, becauſe to be perfect in every good worke, and to doe the
will of God, are really the ſame thing; and therefore theſe can neither be
the end nor the meanes one of another. But this particle is here explicative to
the former words, and is all one with <hi>ſo as;</hi> for he that is perfect
in every good worke or Chriſtian vertue, he truly and properly doth the will
of God. <hi>Working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight</hi>]
He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the way or meanes whereby God is to make them perfect in
every good worke; namely by working in them that which is well-pleaſing in
his ſight. That which pleaſeth God is every good worke. And God worketh a
good worke in us, when he exciteth and moveth us to it, and preventeth us with
his grace while we thinke not of it; when hee miniſtreth unto us ſufficient
ſtrength and helpe thereto, ſuggeſteth occaſions unto us; and laſtly,
when he cheriſheth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth it in us: And not that he worketh in us
without our worke, that is, while we are unwitting, unwilling or idle: but
while we are willing, endeavouring and acting. For, otherwiſe there were
neither need nor reaſon that the Author ſhould exhort us with ſo many
moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, incitements and precepts unto godlineſſe; whereto he with good
reaſon alſo added his wiſh, to teach us, that we muſt joyne Gods helpe
with our endeavours, and our endeavours with his helpe. <hi>Through Ieſus
Chriſt</hi>] It is doubtfull whether theſe words muſt hee joyned with the
word <hi>working,</hi> or with the words <hi>well-pleaſing,</hi> to ſhew us
what is well-pleaſing in the ſight of God; namely that which is done
<hi>through Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and by him commanded to be done. So Peter 1
Epiſt. 2.5. when he had ſaid, that wee muſt offer ſpirituall
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices acceptable unto God, added alſo, by Jeſus Chriſt; ſhewing
us thereby, what thoſe ſacrifices are, namely no other then what are
commanded in the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt. For thoſe words in Peter
ſeeme rather to bee referred to acceptable, then to <hi>offered;</hi>
although the latter may be admitted. <hi>To whom be glory for ever and
ever</hi>] The pronoune <hi>to whom</hi> is placed ſo indifferently by the
Author, that it may be referred both unto God in the former verſe, and to
Jeſus Chriſt, mentioned immediately before. And the Author ſeemes to have
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it ſo of purpoſe, and to reſerve the mention of Chriſt for the
laſt place, that with this one doxology he might celebrate and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both
perſons, both God and Chriſt. For he that is a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cannot be
ignorant, that glory for ever and ever muſt be aſcribed 
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61860:185"/>no leſſe unto Chriſt, then unto God himſelfe.
Whereof reade what is written, Revel. 5.12,13. Whence alſo Peter concludes
his 2. Epiſtle with the like doxologie openly directed unto Chriſt. And
John Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 1.5,6. ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt and magnifying him, doth
ſo place the mention of God the Father, that the pronoune <hi>to him,</hi>
with which he begins his doxology, may be in like manner referred to God the
Father, and to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom he intended to bleſſe. Hence
it manifeſtly appeares that divine worſhip and ſervice is due to our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, together with God the Father. <hi>Amen.</hi>] An Hebrew word
as is well knowne, which ſignifies truly or certainely, and alwayes carries
the force of approbation; and that either in aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in devotions,
of wiſhes, prayers, and praiſes to the honour of God; or laſtly in
promiſes uttered of things very acceptable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable. In
aſſertions it commonly precedeth and is ſet before: but in the other two
it followeth and cloſeth the ſentence. For the former, we meet with many
examples in the ſayings of our Saviour recited by Matthew, Marke, and John:
but Luke relating the ſame or the like ſayings of our Saviour; for the word
Amen, either ſingle or double, uſeth the Greeke word,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which exactly anſwers the
Hebrew, or Syriacke. For the ſecond, there are almoſt ſo many examples in
the holy Scriptures, as there are devotions and praiſes of Gods name in the
end of Epiſtles. For the laſt, there is an example in the end of the
Revelation, verſ. 20. where withall the word Amen is interpreted or
explicated, by addition of the affirmative particle,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

eaſily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>And I beſeech you brethren</hi>] He yet further
addes ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all points as it were out of the body of the Epiſtle.
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> though in the Greeke it properly
ſignifie, <hi>I exhort;</hi> yet in this place it is better tranſlated,
<hi>I beſeech;</hi> as moſt tranſlations render it in ſeverall
languages; becauſe the thing which he entreateth of them, is as it immediatly
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, to <hi>Suffer the word of Exhortation.</hi>] The word of Exhortation
is a ſpeech whereby a man exhorts, or is exhorted, by a genetive caſe
arguing the difference. And in Exhortation eſpecially this which the Authour
here underſtands, is alſo included reprehenſion or reproofe. For he
ſeemes here to deſigne ſuch ſpeech, as is ſomwhat unwelcome and
unpleaſing to them to whom it is directed, as commonly reproofes uſe to be;
although exhortations alſo are many times unpleaſing, though they ſeem
free from any reproofe. For Exhortations to thoſe who do not yet their dutie,
are ſecret reprehenſions and reproofes. Therefore the Authour beſeecheth
and entreateth them, to ſuffer this word or ſpeech; that is, to take it in
good part, not to diſdaine or be grieved at it; that they are exhorted or
admoniſhed by him. <hi>For I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a letter unto you in few
words.</hi>] Here hee addes the reaſon why hee <pb n="360" facs="tcp:61860:186"/>deſires them to ſuffer the word of Exhortation from him. The
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>for</hi> doth not in this place ſignifie ſimply <hi>for,</hi>
but rather <hi>for alſo,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a copulative cauſality, ſo that
here is not brought the ſole cauſe, but the ſociall, and this; omitting
other cauſes whereof they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might eaſily take notice; As for
example, that this word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation was wholeſome for them, that it
proceded from a true and hearty affection toward them; that it was ſpoken
modeſtly on his part, without any bitterneſſe or reproach unto them, and
ſuch like; as if hee had ſaid: Ye ought therefore the rather to ſuffer my
Exhortation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was not onely diligent to apply all things that might
ſerve to lenifie my Exhortation and reproofe, as becommeth him that
admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth: but alſo that I might not give you the leaſt offence. I
have written unto you as briefly as I could, and would not dwell long upon an
argument ſo unpleaſing to you. But if wee ſuppoſe, that by this word of
Exhortation is not meant that part only of this Epiſtle, which conſiſteth
in Exhortation and reprooſe, but even the whole Epiſtle; wherein are not
only Exhortations and reprehenſions, but alſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſolations or
comforts, which in like manner are ſignified by the word Exhortation, and by
the vulgar Latine is here tranſlated the word of Comfort; Then to ſuffer
this word, will be nothing elſe, but to accept it with a ready minde, ſo
that in reading and hearing of it, they would not thinke it ſo prolix and
tedious, as to bee weary of it. To which purpoſe the reaſon here is very
fit, that the Author ſaith, he hath written in few words. For to compriſe
things of ſpeciall moment and worth in few words, as it is a point of great
Art, ſo is it a great grace to the writing. But the Authour calls this
Epiſtle briefe, and written in few words, becauſe conſidering the
Majeſtie of the argument, and the varietie of the matter, it is very briefe,
and delivered but in few words. For we may eaſily perceive that the Author
therein is not indulgent to any repetitions or prolixe amplification after a
Rhetoricall ſtraine: but with a ſingular brevitie runnes over onely the
chiefe points, leaving many more things to be collected by them then he
expreſſeth; and in many things writes very conciſely.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>Know yee that our brother Timotheus is ſet at
libertie</hi>] Another ſpeciall point added by the Author, is an
advertiſement concerning Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, becauſe he was in good repute among the
Hebrews, and went for an Hebrew; for though his father were a Greeke, yet his
mother was an Hebrew, and Paul circumciſed him in favour of the Hebrewes to
ingratiate his perſon among them; as we read, Acts 16.1,2,3. And therefore
the Author ſuppoſeth, that any good newes concerning Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie would be
acceptable to them, to whom his perſon was ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. And the Authour
gives Timothy the attribute of <hi>brother,</hi> thereby to ſignifie not only
their common religion that they both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt; but alſo their
common affection, that each of them was <pb n="361" facs="tcp:61860:186"/>dearly beloved of
other. <hi>Is ſet at libertie</hi>] The particular thing that he
advertiſeth concerning Timothie, and whereof hee deſires them to take
notice or knowledge is, That Timothy <hi>is ſet at libertie,</hi> which
advertiſement he conceived would be very welcom to them. Whence we may
eaſily collect, that Timothy was once in bonds and in priſon for the
profeſſion of the Goſpel. And it is very probable that hee was ſo; for
Paul was then in bonds when hee wrote his Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians; as
appeares, Coloſ. 4.3. where requeſting the prayers of the Coloſſians
for himſelf and his fellow-priſoners, he ſaith; withall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo
for us, that God would open unto us a doore of utterance, to ſpeake the
myſtery of Chriſt, for which I am alſo in bonds. And Paul in his Preface
of ſubſcription to that Epiſtle, adjoynes Timothie with him, as an
approver of his Epiſtle, Coloſſ. 1.1. So that it is probable Timothie was
his fellow-priſoner. And if any man ſay, that Paul names not Timothie among
his fellow-priſoners, when hee mentions their ſeverall ſalutations to the
Coloſſians, chap. 4 The anſwere is; It was not reaſon he ſhould write
any ſalutations from Timothy, no more then from himſelfe; becauſe hee had
joyned Timothie with him as a Co-Authour of the whole Epiſtle, which was more
then a ſalutation. This impriſonment then of Timothie is very probable,
though from this place it be not fully certaine. For the Greeke word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is here tranſlated, ſet
at libertie, doth properly ſignifie more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, for diſmiſſed, or
diſpatched, or ſent away, and in this ſence is frequently uſed in the
new Teſtament. And then it may ſignifie here, that Timothy was now
diſmiſſed, or diſpatched there where formerly hee was detained about
ſome buſineſſe of the Miniſtry; for certaine it is, that Timothy by
his eſpeciall function was an Evangeliſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently
employed by the Apoſtles, who ſent them upon meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about the
Miniſtry unto remote Churches. See this for Timothie, Acts 17.14,15. and Acts
18.5. and Acts 19.22. and 1. Cor. 4.17. and Phil. 2.19. and 1. Theſſ. 3.2.
<hi>With whom if he come ſhortly, I will ſee you</hi>] He intimates unto
them, that hee expects the comming of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie to him very ſhortly; yet
withall, that if hee come not in a ſhort time, then hee himſelf will come
to them without him. So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſignifies his affection and love
toward them, with an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſpeedily to ſee them, as impatient
of his delay in expecting Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, though he were very ſhortly to come.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and
all the Saints</hi>] The name of Saints is here attributed to all Chriſtians
in generall. As if he had ſaid, I deſire you to ſalute from me not onely
your Rulers as your Elders and Biſhops, but all the reſt of the brethren,
even the whole Church. All Chriſtians muſt remember that they are Saints,
that is, perſons conſecrated and hallowed unto God; and therefore as the
Apoſtle admoniſheth, muſt <hi>carry themſelves as obedient children, 
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61860:187"/>not faſhioning themſelves according to their former
luſts in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but as he which hath called them is holy, ſo
muſt they be holy in all manner of converſation; becauſe it is written,
Be yee holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14,15,16. <hi>They of Italy
ſalute you</hi>] A Greciſme for the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, or Chriſtians of Italy;
for ſo the Greeks uſe to ſpeake. Whence it appeares, that part of the
clauſe which tradition hath added at the end of this Epiſtle, is true, That
this Epiſtle was written to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes from Italy. For if the Author had
written from any other place, why ſhould he inſert a ſalutation from the
Italians onely? But the reſt of that clauſe at the end of this Epiſtle is
falſe, That is was ſent by Timothy. For what could be more vaine, then to
write of him, by whom he ſent his Epiſtle? <hi>Know ye that he is ſet at
liberty</hi>] And that in the very end of his Epiſtle, as here he writeth of
Timothy, in the verſe immediately preceding. And beſides in the very ſame
verſe, he advertiſeth them of Timothies comming to him, and of his owne to
them upon Timothies comming to him, namely from that place where he was
detained in priſon; and of his comming or returning from them, as ſome
ſay who would ſeeme to defend this poſtſcript. But there muſt needs
be extant an argument to prove how different from the written word of God, yea
many times repugnant unto it, are the written tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men; and therefore
much more mens traditions not written. And the falſity of this
ſubſcription, may juſtly make a man doubt of the verity of the
inſcription, which carries the name of Paul, traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally alſo prefixed
before it.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Grace be with you all. Amen.</hi>] Here the
Author finiſheth and cloſeth this Epiſtle with a devotion or holy wiſh.
Grace is the onely ground and meanes to that peace whereof he ſtiled God the
Author, before ver. 20. And therefore alſo the onely ground of all
happineſſe, for all happineſſe comes meerly by grace. Yet he
expreſſeth not whoſe grace and favour, he wiſheth unto them, as a thing
ſufficiently knowne among all Chriſtians; namely the grace of God our
Father, and of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Now the ſame grace of God our
Father, and of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, be with all them that love verity and
piety. Amen.</p>
